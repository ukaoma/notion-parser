# Project Pin: Notion Export Parsing Tool

## Project Goals
- Parse Notion exports into structured JSON for AI integrations.
- Store each process for reviewing summaries and articles in a batch.
- Enable comprehensive batch history review and management.
- Provide containerized deployment for easy setup.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (planned)

## Completed Features
1. âœ… Store batch processes with metadata
   - Processing time
   - Cost estimates
   - Token usage
   - Document count

2. âœ… Basic history.vue implementation
   - Display batch list
   - Show processing stats
   - Basic metadata viewing

3. âœ… Enhanced History Features
   - Added detailed batch view
     - Show full document summaries
     - Display all processed documents
     - Show tags and metadata
   - Implemented JSON downloads for historical batches
   - Real-time processing updates
   - Persistent storage of batch history

4. âœ… Error Handling & Progress Tracking
   - Added comprehensive error logging
   - Implemented progress indicators
   - Added cost and token tracking
   - Real-time status updates

## Current Phase: Containerization
1. ðŸ”„ Docker Implementation
   - Create Dockerfile for backend
   - Create Dockerfile for frontend
   - Set up Docker Compose
   - Configure environment variables
   - Add volume mapping for persistence

2. Documentation Updates
   - Add deployment instructions
   - Document environment setup
   - Add container management guidelines

## Next Steps
1. Create Docker configuration
   - Backend service container
   - Frontend service container
   - Network configuration
   - Volume management

2. Add deployment documentation
   - Installation guide
   - Configuration options
   - Environment variables
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. Implement container health checks
   - Service monitoring
   - Auto-restart policies
   - Log management

## Development Tips
- Use TDD: Write tests for each feature before implementing.
- Log extensively: Track every stage of batch storage and retrieval.
- Commit frequently: Break tasks into small milestones.
- Document all new features in both code and user documentation.
- Follow Docker best practices for multi-stage builds.

## Notes
- Keep UI consistent between active processing and history views
- Ensure all data is properly persisted
- Maintain performance with large history lists
- Consider Docker volume management for persistent storage
- Plan for scalability in containerized environment

## Recent Updates
- Added complete document storage in batch history
- Implemented detailed document view with tags
- Added JSON download functionality for processed batches
- Fixed type definitions and interfaces
- Improved error handling and progress tracking

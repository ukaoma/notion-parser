While we were able to push merchants through manually, it led to delays and less than ideal experiences. This has been resolved by rolling back the new version for Canada. </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7f11bdf5-4956-47d9-83fa-17fa407a9456\"><li>Secondly, we optimized several areas in the new version that were previously difficult to navigate. In testing, these were very well received however when we migrated people over to the new version, there were complications that led to people getting stuck. This is not reflective of the new design, but a flaw in the migration of moving people to the new application. At this point, we fixed all occurrences manually and everyone is already migrated so hopefully we won't have to do this again but we will continue to closely monitor.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9e61cdbb-328e-4b54-b37f-2f726aa53a5f\"><li>Plaid updated recently updated<p class=\"\" id=\"e9d36e89-8c3c-49f0-8676-644f4a2c55cb\">The Plaid component recently had an update available and we were told we had time to update our integration. We were slowly working on it since we had time before we needed to update, but we started seeing many bank-related issues. Unfortunately it seems that when the new version came out, they basically seem to have stopped supporting the old version which was unexpected. We scrambled last week to finish updating the Plaid integration so we could stop the pain we were seeing our merchants dealing with. We believe these occurrences are now resolved but there may be a few that are already stuck that we have to push through manually. If you run into any more occurrences of bank-related issues, please submit a PayFac ticket.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"541f705d-2005-4c0f-9cb4-9661d8b86346\"><li>Adyen update released to update onboarding application<p class=\"\" id=\"f9724370-0114-45b4-b701-9ff957d00483\">Adyen released an update to the way they handle onboarding applications. Previously, the onboarding application needed to be fully approved before the merchant could start processing payments or receive payouts. Their new update allows us to decide if we want to let some merchants process payments/payouts before completely finishing their application. While this has interesting applications, unfortunately there was some room for improvement in the suddenness of how they rolled out this change. The end result was that some merchants had information they still needed to fill out on the application but the account statuses were incorrectly showing as fully 'Enabled'. This is still a work in progress and we're working with Adyen to figure out the best path forward to always ensure the statuses are always in sync with Adyen.</p></li></ul>Sep 15 - Sep 21<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d76df3e5-693f-4798-b157-fe213ca87b54\"><li>SFDC Alerts - New SFDC Cases for Bounced Emails ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"7c45b4a9-5ed7-475d-83a0-b426b38aa25c\">The PayFac sends out important email notices to our merchants for things like account creation, chargeback notifications, high risk transaction alerts, and more. Most of the time these emails are received and appreciated however sometimes the emails we're attempting to send to are undeliverable. When this occurs going forward, we'll send an email to that Brand's CX team informing them the merchant's email was undeliverable.

Unreferenced refunds mistakenly also showed two transactions by displaying a phantom positive transaction which made reconciliation difficult.

There are two actions performed as part of deposits: </p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"2e0e1303-6bf2-4a5c-bed3-5eca64dee500\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>When we send the payment (called a sweep) to the merchant's bank. This determines when the funds are received. In order to get Next Day deposits, we have to initiate the sweep before a certain time or it the funds will be paid out later. This was changed some months ago to allow the sweep to be set at midnight their local time zone.</li></ol><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"0f83d5cc-a315-4a69-9091-c1b84644559a\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>When we actually close the batch. This determines the window in which transactions are part of the current deposit and defines which transactions should be included in the following day's deposits. This has been running at midnight ET which sometimes caused confusion around matching the POS and the PayFac's sales. This now looks at the Location to determine the merchant's time zone and defaults to midnight locally.</li></ol><p class=\"\" id=\"51717791-0f38-4f14-b85d-b8ee304a7747\">This means, with occasional exceptions, the batch and the sweep should both get closed at midnight allowing more consistent reconciliation.</p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"44bc008e-3654-41d6-9974-b4c242972805\"><li>(Beta) Payout Report - New Report Design ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"2b337502-aac3-41fe-b1e6-e7376c894d70\">This has been released to the Rain Retail brand exclusively right now. Pending user feedback and other analysis, we will roll it out to everyone as soon as possible</p><p class=\"\" id=\"7c3aaef2-f63a-4491-9290-c093b496426f\">We have released a new version of our Payout Report. The challenge we saw merchants having was that some would run into a negative balance through refunds or chargebacks meaning they would owe us money. We would withhold payouts or do a direct ACH withdrawal to cover the balance but we didn't have a good way for them to see the outstanding amount owed themselves. This new design is a subtle change from what it was previously but now shows two new sections:</p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"ae36971f-b064-4996-884f-2d367eb58a71\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>The upper section (top left) will show merchants their current balance- If it's positive then that amount represents what their next payout should be. If it's negative then that amount is what's owed.</li></ol><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"d2bd7112-5b7b-4318-8c5e-c608133bcf61\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>The bottom section (under the Payout Totals) will only show if multiple payouts have been attempted (bad bank information) or if they have a negative balance we're offsetting against. In either case, we will show the attempted payout with all the detailed listed. When it turns into a successful payout, it will be moved into the Payouts section above and be removed from the Pending section below. The intention is that if the merchant has a negative balance, they can see how they're progressing to paying off that balance and if they have bad bank details, they can see what payouts they should expect to receive when it's updated.</li></ol><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(11).png\"></a><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(12).png\"></a><p class=\"\" id=\"b72e70e3-d6ed-455f-8ab4-42d90b10143c\">\n</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ec4c1665-6efc-4e7d-8006-4711d8a34e2d\"><li>Payments Page - New Filter Type ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"eb70f181-8188-4c2b-83c2-fac73896850d\">This page can now be filtered by Payment Method (Card Present, Card Not Present, Manual Entry, etc).</p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(13).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4ba6f713-9c56-4754-89b3-38021f5a6a86\"><li>Onboarding Application - V2 Now Released (Adyen - US Merchants) ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"debe7f92-0edd-4f9b-8819-582207b534f6\">NOTE: This has been released only for US merchants.

This was due to POS-level configuration where merchants would accept an authorization at one location but capture it from another. This resulted in the transaction erroneously showing up in the wrong location's payouts. This has been resolved.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4f6b7061-00de-41e5-bcf9-2dbd437e82f3\"><li>Account Creation - Creating International Accounts (Adyen) 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"651cd7ac-6984-454d-b437-a0e62c399812\">We were allowing merchant accounts to be created in countries we do not support. This caused confusion with our On-boarders and with our merchants since everything appeared to be functional except when the application started to get filled out. This has now been resolved.</p></li></ul>Sep 01 - Sep 07<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"2fabb571-348d-49be-b675-bea820bdc38e\"><li>No new updates for this week</li></ul>Aug 25 - Aug 31<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"3179ba6b-e3d2-4b26-b043-b41f9dfbd098\"><li>Payout Report - Display Transaction ID for Disputes 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"552725da-dad7-4c62-b125-6520e58794d7\">We are working on several chargeback improvements. As part of those updates, we cleaned up transaction ID's for chargebacks in the Payouts report. Previously, a chargeback would show the internal payment intent on the Payout report which wasn't helpful to our merchants since those aren't searchable in the POS. We now correctly show the external (POS) transaction ID so the merchants can quickly see which transaction was disputed. This was fixed for both Stripe and Adyen.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"aa5f5f7d-bba9-4e82-85e5-1f273c645ebb\"><li>Payout Report - IC+ Export 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"cce3de0b-846d-44dc-bbf4-43d8371d2b49\">We fixed an issue that resulted in bad data for merchants that changed from one pricing model to a different pricing model (Flat Rate &gt; IC+ or vice versa). This was causing the the IC+ export to be confusing for our merchants since we had two different fees being displayed. This is now corrected and should update the export based on which pricing model is used. We also now show the pricing model for any given transaction on the Payments page export.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f9f61c0e-eebe-4d9d-8168-284680644881\"><li>Account Creation - Currency Support 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"4aa0b89a-95b8-4b24-81c2-b049dd9db571\">We saw issues where merchant accounts were being created in one country with the currency of another (United States merchant with currency code of CAD). This would prevent transactions from going through since the two settings didn't match and, while it was a POS configuration issue, it something we could resolve on the PayFac side. When we see this occur, we will now automatically change the currency to be that of the country the merchant operates in.</p></li></ul>Aug 18 - Aug 24<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c15e05f6-fe18-4bbf-a6d0-0f304376c309\"><li>Email Notifications - Updated Email Service ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"03594884-de7a-4357-ac45-86fd399f205d\">We recently discovered a lot of our emails (new account creation, chargeback alerts, etc) were getting blocked or suppressed. We identified the cause and as part of the resolution, we navigated to a new email service. This has now been resolved and send rates are up to 100% as of now.NOTE: This requires work from each POS Brand so it has not been enabled for everyone. As soon as the POS developers for each brand update their side, this change should automatically go into effect for them.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c7c0498a-1a4e-4a9a-8d9c-14a5f2025db7\"><li>Payment Portal - Date/Time Settings⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"be83d0ea-5ffc-4c65-9acb-0fc603682e37\">Due to an old configuration setup, the date and time of transactions were always being displayed in that person's local time zone based on wherever they were viewing the page from. This meant that in some cases, if a merchant was looking at the Payments page in Pacific time and one of our team members was viewing it in Eastern time, the transactions could show up in different days due to the different time zones. This has now been changed so the date and time of a transaction always show consistently in the store's time zone.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a814db66-12fb-49e6-9c45-eab1cca50633\"><li>Payout Report - IC+ Report not Displaying🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"a3687b0c-f119-416b-b8f7-97fc7d17ccb6\">Fixed an issue which had resulted in the monthly IC+ report only showing for Super Admins and not for merchant users. This has now been resolved and the report should show for anyone that has access to the reports.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"322a2731-1041-47b7-9e67-107f207d7582\"><li>Onboarding Application V2 - Statuses 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"b745b01f-f09e-447d-9b08-a82a220fc71e\">For some merchants on V2 of the new onboarding application, we saw a temporary issue where the status in Adyen and our Payment Portal would not correctly sync. This meant that some merchants saw their application stuck in various statuses when in reality, they should have been marked as Enabled or Restricted. This has been resolved and now the application should correctly display the right statuses.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ff0e5a7f-fca4-4021-8d3c-55d18ad23f50\"><li>Payments/Payout Pages - Not Loading for Some Users 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"792c2d9a-94c8-4ba3-ab20-70520997946a\">We had reports last week of the Payment and Payout pages not loading for some merchants.

We have fixed this and now all users can see these pages again.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"844cfe49-6a7a-4e11-8186-9a96dac4db55\"><li>Risk - Automate High Risk Email Alerts ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"fd2e4e6f-e2d2-488b-8fb1-5bfb02bf6db8\">For a while now, we've been manually sending merchants emails about high-risk transactions. These are transactions which pose a higher-than-normal level of risk for the merchant and/or we suspect to be fraud. For anything we are sure is fraud, we block outright but for some transactions that might be real, we allow through and let the merchant decide. For these transactions, while we do allow them through, we also alert the merchant to be cautious about it and do their due diligence. This had been manual and at the pace we were growing, this was not scalable. We have now automated this process. Nothing should change for the merchant.</p></li></ul>Aug 11 - Aug 17<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"8ecb2074-d316-4382-84a6-9b3ad690f7e2\"><li>Onboarding Application - ID File Upload 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"14573320-9928-4aab-90e0-ebbcf1a1000a\">Adyen changed the way they needed to receive ID documents and our previous process was no longer compliant which caused a couple of accounts to go into Restricted unnecessarily. We have since corrected the backend to correctly pass this information. Nothing should change for the merchant, but in the backend we will start combining the front and back into a single document and uploading it to Adyen with a new identifier.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"73bab194-3f63-474e-b60f-af16a1eb29f4\"><li>Onboarding Application - Non-Profit UBO Document🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"fbd05d8b-7e54-4357-8d79-0729fbae1377\">When non-profit (ThriftCart) merchants onboard, they have to upload a file called a UBO document. This helps us determine how the person filling out the application relates to the business they are representing. Adyen changed the way they have us pass this information. We have updated this process so this should be resolved going forward.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"38c6f7da-f22a-4693-8ac8-e2d79a31b6cb\"><li>Onboarding Application V2 - Beta Group ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"e8964291-115d-4f4f-bb13-0ccce2e82d7c\">We have 20 beta merchants using V2 of the onboarding application and have received no bug reports or negative feedback yet.

Some preferred only the payouts themselves to export since they just wanted to store the summary data on their local machine. Other merchants wanted the export to include all the transaction data as well. The report has historically worked both ways both with mixed reviews so now we allow the merchant to choose how they want it to work. When they press the Export button on the Payout report, it will show a new window letting them choose how they want it to work.</p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(7).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"93e115c1-c5e6-4305-963e-95fbe2c764d1\"><li>Onboarding Application - Version 2 (Beta Release)⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"75c6c1a0-9c5b-47ee-a432-41c6bdb07138\">After a LOT of product and user research, we have overhauled the onboarding application.

This can happen when refunds/chargebacks exceed positive transactions received during that time period. When this happens, the balance is normally offset by their daily sales volume however if the balance exceeds a certain amount then we do a direct withdrawal from their bank account. When this happens, it would screw up the payout reporting reconciliation. Now when this happens we have a new line item called 'Balance Recovery'.</p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(6).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"5c2efe0f-7b64-45c7-87e0-a93ce2405883\"><li>Onboarding Application - Various File Upload Errors🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"6b2bb673-69c9-4d04-9070-8410b2e15897\">We fixed several issues related to uploading files. This affected uploading IDs, bank statements, and business registration documents. This primarily affected merchants who got into a bad state due to submitting the application incorrectly then uploading duplicate files. This is now fixed and we have a more streamlined flow for bad states.</p></li></ul>Jul 14 - Jul 20<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d3c8d9be-7eee-4ce7-965c-4fcc844332fe\"><li>New Email - Bank Account Failed ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"430b118c-ee3d-47ad-b37d-115e4f023280\">As part of our onboarding process, bank account information gets verified and approved. Despite that, payouts still sometimes fail. This is usually due to account information changing, fraud, accounts closing or other outstanding circumstances. When this occurred we did not have a good way to notify the merchant. Now when we attempt a payout and it's returned as failed, we alert the merchant by updating that payout status to 'Cancelled', pause future payouts (since we know they'll fail), and email the merchant this new email:</p>Dear [Customer’s Name],<p class=\"\" id=\"5ad7ba81-288a-456a-af72-446f8856298c\">We are writing to inform you that we recently attempted to process your payout, but unfortunately the bank account details provided appear to be invalid, resulting in a failed transaction.

Coming Soon.)</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"24830e6a-c37b-425f-903e-895c9e5b357a\"><li>Risk - Auto-Disable Payouts ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"7f67df8f-5bf3-4857-9083-b2e01551a0a6\">To help protect our merchants and ourselves, we rolled out some changes to automatically pause payouts for merchants we identify as potentially fraudulent or high-risk. We won't be sharing what these conditions are publicly but we implemented some tools about two months ago to help us determine the impact and found that it should not affect legitimate merchants or internal teams. If you have any questions about why a merchant may have had their payouts disabled, feel free to reach out to: <a href=\"https://quilt-corporate.slack.com/team/U05FVBHQ831\">@Jackson Oglesby</a> or <a href=\"https://quilt-corporate.slack.com/team/U06FT725WAH\">@Eric Saylor</a></p></li></ul>Jul 07 - Jul 13<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"88c8d054-a755-4d53-a2a4-05fb5426b1cf\"><li>New User Details Page ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"a30e140f-f048-4307-987e-e87168dfe3c2\">We released a new user details page. Right now, we're keeping it pretty non-descript and it can only currently be used by that user to reset their own password. We are planning on adding 2FA soon so this page will get more updates as part of that release. For now, this can be accessed by clicking on the username under the 'Profile' menu link.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"668f9339-2b4a-4407-b55d-7597f517289b\"><li>Payment Portal - Terminals Still Paired to Deleted Accounts 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"bfc26cbf-228e-4024-9e94-fe26d0eca862\">We've been receiving more requests recently to delete accounts that have cancelled. Often this was part of a change-of-ownerships process and the terminals would get \"stuck\" being paired to the now deleted account and couldn't be repaired. This has now been resolved and when an account is deleted, it unpairs the terminals.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"555106ed-12bb-4177-8d05-31cf11400bc0\"><li>IC+ Pricing Model - Auth &amp; Refund Fees 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"8f443d52-da2f-462e-b8b5-186f5e6901f6\">Interchange Plus (IC+) is a complicated pricing model that has a lot of moving components. We found recently that a small portion of our fees were not getting charged correctly and merchants were getting undercharged specifically when authorizing and refunding transactions. We have since resolved this. Due to the small amounts, we are not retroactively collecting fees for any past-due amounts and merchants should not notice any major change to their billing.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"16938757-bb39-41d8-acd4-d19b6ef5d9bc\"><li>Onboarding Application - Added Birthdate Validation 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"4a8e934d-3a9f-412e-8caa-1eda3704cb9f\">We recently discovered that in some cases, the merchant's date of birth was not getting passed to Adyen which would cause the account to fail validation. This was due to user error where the merchant would enter values for their birthdate that were not correct (letters, special characters, etc). When passing this data to Adyen, they would not accept it, leaving the account in a failed status. We now have validation of our own that prevents silly people from entering silly things in this field.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"76a9c6e7-9db2-4932-ad1b-fe379ea98a25\"><li>Onboarding Application - Added Store Name Validation 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"0794513d-d659-4ef0-9ca0-223d64863404\">When configuring new accounts, Adyen requires different merchant Id's that are used for different purposes. One of those Id's had a minimum 3-character requirement which we were using the store's name as the value for. Unfortunately this meant that stores with a name equal to or less than 3 characters would fail and cause the onboarding application to error out. This has now been resolved and we have a fix to handle this in the backend.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ec22d29d-3e63-4725-b63a-8e864ad4315d\"><li>Onboarding Application - SSN Error 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"59082629-6dcb-4d53-bdf9-371e4e1bec3b\">We've had a pesky issue with the SSN that keeps popping up temporarily but we believe it is now officially resolved. Occasionally, a merchant would enter the last 4 of their social, get an error message that they would need to enter their full social, and then not be allowed by the application to do so. We finally discovered this was due to different parent/child error codes on Adyen's end that we hadn't mapped out yet. We added that mapping and this should now be resolved once and for all.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9ef9ede0-ef1a-4b43-836a-f34d65ceabd2\"><li>Onboarding Application - Plaid 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"883e26a3-9b92-47fe-ada6-d2dff72dbbce\">We fixed an issue with Plaid that resulted in the page showing an infinite 'waiting' screen. This would prevent merchants from being unable to proceed or continue. Now, the page should load as expected and allow merchants to enter their bank details.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"57a9aaa9-6b4f-44d2-b0d5-1528e5e9426d\"><li>SCHEDULED P5 APP RELEASE<p class=\"\" id=\"b08b7302-1249-4ce7-8a55-43df7a3b6460\">P5 Terminal App Version 1.294 (Exact app # may change) is scheduled to release on or near Monday, 07/22/24.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"88780ff2-e9ad-4134-8a99-5475d2801f28\">Unlike ROM updates, app updates generally do not require the merchant to do anything special and should update behind the scenes without interruption. This app release has one small bug fix and one REALLY HUGE update I'm sure everyone will be very excited for.</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0995bcb0-af44-4893-9b6d-9f5a6e5b0f65\"><li>App Auto-Launch IMPROVEMENTS!<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"983f2a76-8168-4d1d-8f38-5bf874ad2ad6\"><li>We released auto-launching the app last month but there were still reasons merchants had to leave the app which made the update less impactful. Now the app will automatically detect if it needs to connect to the internet and/or if it needs to have the date/time fixed and will direct the users to those pages. No more need to exit the app and navigate around the terminal to update those settings. This should seriously streamline the hardware onboarding process.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9c5d3bb9-c06a-4577-b411-0aa0dd5b01a5\"><li>EBT Bug Fixed<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d25da694-f09b-4e93-bf97-7cc8c640d75b\"><li>Fixed a small issue with EBT where PINs that included '0' in it would not be accepted.

When doing so, there is a short form to fill out about the merchant. Previously the Opp ID had to be added to the Profile page after the account was created. Now, it's been added to the new account creation form which allows an Onboarder to insert that ID while creating the account instead of afterward.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"b8fa35ae-b986-42a5-bc91-ebc74d96d46f\"><li>Payment Portal - Custom Pricing🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"89c90d1c-5aa5-45a1-92ae-05d93204c579\">Previously when entering custom rates, with no per-transaction fee, the Portal would allow an empty value to be saved which would cause an error when attempting to process a transaction. We have now removed the ability for no value to be saved which should prevent that error from occurring in the future.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"5cd4d790-023c-4cc4-b8c3-2ec02f4807a0\">Note: This will still allow a $0 fee to be entered- we just removed the ability to save a 'NULL' value.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4f77a1d7-4b6b-47b3-a635-f1bfbc0f4831\"><li>Onboarding Application - Account Status 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"dd693ca1-448e-49f5-a4ee-b3d5c83ed318\">Fixed an inconsistency with Adyen statuses that sometimes shows an application as 'Enabled' when it was still in 'Restricted'. This was due to the statuses being stored in two different locations within Adyen which do not always match. Now an account should only be marked as 'Enabled' if both locations in Adyen match.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0b7a69d3-063d-43fa-9a0a-0d71d81ce89c\"><li>Payout Report - Reconciliation Logic 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"8a625c07-3462-47ec-a7ab-3f7f6dd7ab59\">Currently, for a number of reasons, some payouts require longer reconciliation than others. In the past this made it so all subsequent payouts would show as '0' and display the '48 hour reconciliation' text. Now, only the affected payout will show that text and all subsequent payouts will display normally.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"45836240-b8e2-4b0f-b91d-cb679c493ba6\"><li>Payments Page - Transaction Search 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"6adf3871-d78a-4810-b8fa-8d33ceff166e\">Fixed an infinite loading screen that occurred when a merchant/internal admin tried searching a transaction ID on the Payments page.

We also identified how it was occurring and put measures in place to stop that.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"db841293-f710-4f7a-bea1-0418f9fb366c\"><li>Transactions - Better Help Text for \"Tap Limit Exceeded\" Error ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"8bf2e4f0-c0f7-41d0-94f5-70f0718a59e3\">Interac has a daily tap limit but we didn't do a good job of displaying helpful error code text when this occurs. Now we will display new text that prompts the shopper to insert their card instead of tapping which should reduce any potential confusion over what's needed.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ed7bd695-57ca-4fdb-8d03-d4940fdad683\"><li>Payout Report - Date Sequence (Stripe) 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"cce2ff4a-032c-45c1-8a50-17f37321f19c\">Fixed an issue that resulted in some Stripe accounts seeing their payouts out of order.

All this means is that the funds are delayed into another payout but because this can cause confusion, we added new help text to inform the merchant of what's happening.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"03a41254-6c1c-4da9-82d6-c15e85563a80\"><li>Previously when a payout would fail, it would give the 'Please wait up to 48 hours for reconciliation' message which was incorrect and confusing. Now when a payout fails it will have new text that says 'Payout was unable to be deposited. Please update your bank account information to resume deposits'. The status will also show as 'Cancelled'.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"82a92862-176c-49ff-abd7-f7307b80cb4d\"><li>On the Payout report, the 'Refunds' section would show as positive numbers.

In these scenarios, Adyen requires a picture of the front and back of the ID in separate uploads. The error page UI now supports uploading the front and back in two separate uploads.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"25f3f172-b80b-4731-a58b-b59ba1e6ee6c\"><li>Payments Page - Inconsistent Font Size 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"a1c6f1fc-da90-4023-8690-ef7b84c17453\">The Payments Page column headers had inconsistent font sizes which were sometimes hard for our merchants to read.

Going forward, we will have a default rates for both Flat Rate and Interchange Plus. This means that only merchants sold on custom rates will need any work done to update pricing.<p class=\"\" id=\"2556fd0c-0b68-4cad-b725-8e28a10c69ac\">NOTE: For now, this is only updated for Rain subsidiaries.

Previously if you wanted to set up Next-Day instead of Two-Day funding, it would require you knowing that you needed to set the batch time to 8pm ET or earlier which was not at all intuitive and caused a lot of questions. In addition, the 8pm ET cutoff meant that reconciliation would be harder since merchants may have an online sale come in after 8pm which would fall onto the next batch.<p class=\"\" id=\"9d0abe56-5357-40f4-8fed-8db118fbe362\">Instead, we worked with Adyen to get midnight cut-offs for both Next-Day and Two-Day funding. This should make reconciliation a lot easier and make setting the funding schedule a lot more intuitive.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"b75acd79-83da-4222-abc8-24469ae079ec\">Now, the only consideration when configuring sweep schedules is their time zone since that will affect when the funds are paid out the following day.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"3858e344-8e25-45d5-9abb-65c6345d9e54\">When configuring the sweep schedule, it will now tell you when the funds should arrive.

As a reminder, Plaid allows for faster/easier bank validation during onboarding and should significantly speed up that process. We rolled it out for Rain a while ago to test and so far the resulted have been very encouraging. It's now been released for everyone which means any new accounts or accounts in a 'Created' status should use the new Plaid flow. If you experience any issues please submit a PayFac ticket asap.

Previously if a transaction was refunded, then the original transaction on the Payments page would get updated. This was confusing since without going back to the original transaction, the merchant would have no way of knowing if it was successfully refunded or not.

This app release has a few key new features including:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"840d2ff2-6608-41a3-8641-7a376a4fda88\"><li>New audio beep settings<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"40dcbb20-a09d-49f9-817f-eb42da0f6733\"><li>This will help with merchants used to terminals beeping from previous processors and those who want to better serve those with visual impairments</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9015dc9a-fb06-44e7-afd9-162b2c012f33\"><li>A new screen for contactless payments to help shoppers know when to remove the card<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"94e82d45-7c27-44e3-8af6-511cdeebf38d\"><li>We found a decent number of transactions failed because users remove the card too fast so this should help with that</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"eb1d4d64-5cf9-44df-8922-e6e88b33d8a2\"><li>Updated the Pairing Code process to be a 6-digit numeric code instead of a 3-word pairing code.<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1c758fbc-d5f9-4f03-a5f8-8de7de602b23\"><li>Turns out spelling is hard, who knew 🤷‍♂️</li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a3b486be-08a1-42fb-ae8e-e95cceb1cda7\"><li>More bug fixes 🙂</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"3d13e519-5480-42f6-9ed0-03987cb32863\">Additional details and updated documentation can be found here: <a href=\"Hardware%20f64d20cb3422404a8dd0c6478601db00/Terminal%20App%20Release%20Schedule%20d1d91f50615744b0b1afc60237ffef5d.html\">SCHEDULED RELEASE: App Version 1.275</a></p></li></ul>Apr 21 - Apr 27<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e2568c9f-02db-4f7e-be37-b38d126ec746\"><li>Payments Page - Broke Out 'Incomplete' Status ⭐On the Payments Page, we have an 'Incomplete' transaction status that was also being used for cancelled transactions. Now incomplete and cancelled will show up as different statuses allowing merchants and internal teams to better differentiate a cancelled transaction from an incomplete one.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"5d326d94-57ae-4757-9159-030bab9f7d9f\"><li>Merchant List Page - Date Enabled Improvements ⭐After recently adding 'Date Enabled' on the Merchant List page, we made the column sortable and it's now included in the Merchant List page export.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"438cf0af-2cd1-418c-afbf-89368547dbfa\"><li>KYC Page - Added Plaid Usage Data⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"b7cd8de7-1663-4c6b-907d-740ccf46786f\">On the KYC page, we now show if Plaid was used during onboarding. There are three possible data values:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"880cfa73-9f57-4564-bd5c-8f940295da97\"><li>Plaid: Automated. This is where the merchant went through the automated Plaid process.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"488dbc35-6298-4dd9-b538-54413b9fa32b\"><li>Plaid: Manual. This is where the merchant used Plaid but went through the manual process.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"819a834b-8410-420f-8d36-8f368c6aadce\"><li>Manual. This is where a merchant did not use Plaid (was not enabled for them at the time)</li></ul><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Untitled%209.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c5d60034-1906-4a67-ad85-807fdac7b01e\"><li>Profile Page - Fixed Missing Features Settings 🐞For a short time, a new change resulted in the 'Features' section (Donations, Tips, Receipt Printing) disappearing from the Profile page. That has since been resolved and the feature settings should be visible again.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"73f92922-267b-4127-a67c-60e9dcd69f0c\"><li>Profile Page - Fixed Edit Rates Button 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"603c96ba-2e6e-4354-b7ce-d190624fee3c\">For a short time, a new change resulted in the edit rates button disappearing from the Profile page. That has since been resolved and the button should be visible again.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9f6c9fbb-125f-4c7d-92c3-774f57bcc9ee\"><li>Payments Page - Next Button on Payments Page Fixed 🐞The next button on the Payments page stopped working preventing merchants from navigating to subsequent pages. This has been resolved and the button works as expected again.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9d8ec9cb-d783-4fbd-92f1-bcd46232ee2f\"><li>Fee Structure - Interchange and Assessments 🐞Resolved a small issue that resulted in some interchange fees not being passed onto merchants that are on the IC+ pricing structure. This resulted in merchants being undercharged by a small amount each month. While the issue is now fixed, we will not be retroactively collecting anything so merchants shouldn't notice any difference.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"8c84d56b-23c8-44c2-8de0-4212f1e331c4\"><li>Disputes - Fixed Logging Attempts 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"6d8ba084-b091-4fec-82ce-8efea8379efe\">If a dispute fee couldn't be charged, it resulted in the attempt being made several times per minute until it was eventually successful. This had no affect on merchants aside from the Payments page logs showing many attempts which was confusing to internal teams. This has now been resolved.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a23b43b7-2fae-49a9-8dab-e254f184037e\"><li>Payout Report - Fixed Payout Report Issue 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"3a9d91c8-d411-4c6d-a55c-fbf1c01fd764\">From time to time, a reserve/limit has to be placed on a merchant's account. This holds a specific amount of funds until certain conditions are met. When this happened, it caused the Payout report to no longer reconcile. We have now fixed this so when these occurrences do happen, the Payout Report is no longer affected.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"680a6759-bb09-43bf-8acd-794a6f93d15e\"><li>Onboarding Application - Fixed Bank Display 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"5b08a568-548c-4f44-94fb-10824b6da201\">We discovered an issue that resulted in the bank details displaying as 'Invalid' on the summary page instead of correctly showing the last four of the account number and bank name as intended. This caused confusion with merchants and led to inbound calls since it appears that the bank verification failed. This has now been fixed and bank details should correctly show going forward.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0f82551d-8597-4679-a45d-641de7f7acd8\"><li>ROM Update<p class=\"\" id=\"0740defb-d076-4b19-9dc1-022e5f7fa834\">Over the last week we have been rolling out a ROM update for the terminals.  Everyone was notified ahead of time and asked to leave their devices on and plugged in over the weekend.  There were two big fixes in this update:</p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"57d55c1a-ab85-42a6-b277-b604a6d12ccd\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>Fixed the issue where the system clock would reset when the device restarted.</li></ol><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"0e46ccd3-56a0-47e4-ad2c-72ea623d52f2\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>Included a fix which should reduce the frequency of an issue where the battery discharges beyond the auto-protection threshold and prevents the device from charging.</li></ol></li></ul>Apr 14 - Apr 20<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"fc402491-41b2-4342-be9f-56eb898c4006\"><li>Donations - Exposed Global Settings ⭐Donations is now available for Jewel360 merchants (pending any changes on the Rain side). As part of this update, we exposed the API so the Donation settings can be configured and controlled for all merchants globally. This is helpful if merchants in a particular industry or business unit all want the same donation settings.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6a8b180c-95c1-46e4-a8a7-577a804f4c62\"><li>Merchant List Page - Added Date Enabled ⭐As you may have already seen, we removed the 'Switch Account' link and instead made the store name clickable. In its place, we added 'Date Enabled' to help provide better visibility and data for our Onboarding teams.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e76dd5c4-86d7-4fcb-b46b-780a6940733e\"><li>Payments Page - Cleaned Up Status Filter ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"61622e99-1b63-4e6d-baa4-55b63fb29df2\">The 'Payment Status' filter on the Payments page allows users to filter between the different states a transaction can be in. Adyen and Stripe have different, unique, statuses a transaction can be in and this filter unintentionally displayed both at all times. Now the filter will only show the payment statuses for the processor that is enabled for that merchant (Stripe merchants will see Stripe transaction statuses and Adyen merchants will see Adyen statuses).</p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(1).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9838fb5e-17f1-4478-9ee1-7548c5d86470\"><li>Profile Page - Removed Ability to Edit/Add Terminals from Payment Portal for Some Brands ⭐Some of our POS software's manage terminals directly from the POS. This means merchants can log into their POS to pair/remove terminals or locations rather than needing to log into the Payment Portal. Previously we still allowed these merchants to add terminals directly to the Payment Portal which often caused issues with the POS software. Now, if the POS manages terminals then we do not allow merchants to edit terminals within the Payment Portal and instead we show a new prompt directing them to the right place. This should cause less issues between the Payment Portal and the POS and reduce inbound calls to our Customer Service teams. <a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Untitled%2010.png\"></a></li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"f838ff63-30f0-41a4-9a8a-5fe7ce0cd2f7\">\n</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9c8ca5be-d8ee-4aab-9c43-c0634abd138b\"><li>Automated Emails - Added Business Name ⭐<p class=\"\" id=\"919494a9-8d3f-4788-b030-2849d86a877e\">In some of our new emails we did not list the business name which caused confusion among multi-location merchants. We have now added the business name so the stores will be able to differentiate which location the email is referencing.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c7fda589-a030-49e3-a9f5-aad2ce4ec31d\"><li>Payouts - New Setting to Disable Payouts for Self-Sign Up ⭐Across some of our brands, merchants can signup with and start processing without ever having spoken to one of our team members. We refer to this as self-signup. While this self-enablement is a powerful selling feature, it does carry with it some risk since we are not able to vet these merchants in the same way. In these scenarios we now disable payouts by default until our Risk Team can sign off on them. This should not impact onboarding in any way but if there are questions, please feel free to reach out to our Risk Team- <a href=\"https://quilt-corporate.slack.com/team/U06FT725WAH\">@Eric Saylor</a> or <a href=\"https://quilt-corporate.slack.com/team/U05FVBHQ831\">@Jackson Oglesby</a>.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"95bd5c3e-8cf3-4911-a5e3-22e2bc5cda4c\"><li>Plaid - Fixed Issue With Editing Bank Accounts for Manual Upload 🐞We found a new issue that appeared for some merchants using Plaid who decided to use the manual verification process instead of the automated flow. In these situations, merchants entered data incorrectly and had to edit the information to proceed however the portal did not allow them to do so. We have now fixed this issue so that merchants can now edit bank details as expected if data is entered incorrectly.<p class=\"\" id=\"09704619-bb14-4516-8935-459d0b8d8ae6\">This affected around 12 merchants in onboarding so if you experienced issues with Plaid last week, this should now be resolved.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4ee10843-3517-458e-a02e-88246dffd9da\"><li>Payout Report - Fixed Total Alignment 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"1587b713-c1b3-499f-976b-f1ef78d64006\">The Payout Report totals were misaligned causing confusion with some merchants. This has now been resolved and the alignment should no longer cause confusion. </p><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Untitled%2011.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"dc0ba50b-5fe5-4e90-8cb4-8967aad195e4\"><li>Manual Entry - Fixed Issue With IP Address 🐞<p class=\"\" id=\"41b4bba5-da3c-4f19-8ca7-4453ac47d675\">In some rare cases, we found transactions getting blocked for stores with IP addresses that Adyen found potentially suspicious. Since all manual entry transactions are done at the store, the IP address is not relevant and we stopped passing this data to Adyen to prevent additional transactions from getting blocked.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"77783878-1973-4850-81df-3baafa334c4b\"><li>Making some changes to the Merchant List page<p class=\"\" id=\"a9c94d78-9711-4d76-88c8-fdb6946a61c0\">we're making some changes to the Merchant List page. In case there's any confusion, the name will now be clickable instead of the old 'switch account' link. In its place, we'll be adding 'Date Enabled' to help provide better visibility and data for our Onboarding teams. Again, this is actively being worked on so if you see things changing, do not panic.</p></li></ul>Apr 7 - Apr 13<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c8517d55-31bd-4385-892d-cbb320074e47\"><li>Onboarding Application - Updated 'Need More Info' Email (ADYEN) ⭐When a merchant submits their application and we're unable to automatically approve them, they used to receive an email informing them that something needs to updated about their account. The email was very generic and did not tell them what needed to be fixed. Now we tell the specific error message(s) and provide a link to update the application.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Untitled%2012.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"202537ed-dfd4-4a24-88f9-c5462304098b\"><li>Payout Report - In Transit Messaging ⭐We are continuing to make changes here to try and avoid confusion and reduce inbound requests with payouts. Occasionally payouts will be deposited but unexpected behavior resulted in us having to manually reconcile the payout before we can show the exact list of transactions. Under the affected deposit in the Payout Report, we added new text: \"Payments are currently being reconciled with this payouts and may take up to 48 hours.\" </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1c5f19cf-ce1e-474d-bc4c-be11f2d0a704\"><li>Payment Portal - New Resend Email ⭐In the Profile page, under the Requirements section, we now have the ability to resend an email to a merchant. As a reminder, these emails automatically resend every Tuesday but this allows CSMs/Onboarders to send one right away.Note: The email sent is based on their application status. For example, if they have started the application but not submitted it, then the email sent will be the 'Reminder' email that encourages them to submit their application. If they've submitted the application but need to update something then it will be the 'Needs More Info' email.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Untitled%2013.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"270c8053-248f-4c4f-ad66-2dc587ff5949\"><li>Payment Portal - Edit Payout Descriptor ⭐Based on demand, we have added the ability to edit deposit descriptions. This is the description that shows up in the merchant's bank account when we make a deposit. The main use-case for this is when merchants want to be able to visually differentiate deposits for multi-location that are getting paid into the same account.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4f8faa33-77c9-4dc4-8fc8-1fa9c1c6c9d8\"><li>Payout Report - Visual Improvements ⭐We made some small visual adjustments to the IC+ Report to make it easier to read. This included removing the 'Total Fees' column since we break out all the individual fee types and adding some descriptive text under the Monthly Summary informing merchants when data should be available for download.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"39f2098c-5bc3-4292-80a6-a91bc63552fa\"><li>Payment Portal - Fixed Receipt Printing ON/OFF Button 🐞Fixed an issue on the Profile page that resulted in the Receipt Printing ON/OFF button from not displaying. When enabled, the button now correctly appears and allows merchants to turn receipt printing on/off as needed.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1834c931-6ef7-44ce-b012-24dbce826c77\"><li>Payout Report - Fixed 'Net Deposited' Not Showing on Export 🐞Fixed an issue with the 'Net Deposited' amounts not showing on the report export.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"af3e1e80-b7ca-4c05-829f-8eb133e1b2da\"><li>SCHEDULED APP RELEASE - small hotfix going out to solve some recent app crashes with the P5 terminal<p class=\"\" id=\"b11a2706-182e-41a4-901d-65a20e0073f4\">We have a small hotfix going out to solve some recent app crashes with the P5 terminal.

Instead of a generic 'Error' message, we will start providing additional details about why the transaction failed.

This ROM version fixes the issue with the date/time settings occasionally reverting back after being powered off.<p class=\"\" id=\"ed1c200e-84f6-4331-91de-4dfb10325e13\">We'll be scheduling the update for late at night so there's no interruption in service and will be coordinating in-app alerts and emails to inform merchants where possible BUT ROM updates can take a little while so we need the device powered on and plugged in overnight which will be part of the messaging we send out. If a merchant does not have their terminal powered on then the next time they do so, it will force the update.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f62ca309-649a-46f6-b0d9-7836aa039b2e\"><li>PayFac Slackbot updates<p class=\"\" id=\"98a1ce59-826e-4b9c-8c28-5fd75ee4f806\">The PayFac support slackbot has been updated with additional features:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"731a6317-9364-4760-be36-6380f44d80db\"><li>The /terminal command now supports the P5, S1F2, and Stripe terminals.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a1d6f0b3-7a0b-4730-822b-50444c0204f1\"><li>The /terminal command now includes ROM version, battery level and wifi signal strength for P5 terminals.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6037b895-8a9e-4590-9633-6f0e1379695d\"><li>A new command /payment has been added that can provide summary information about payments.</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"e2bd6a48-b010-4db8-907e-d47b4796b95d\">The commands are:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ae3832b2-4111-474d-ae90-d68c82593c1c\"><li>/terminal &lt;ID/Serial&gt;</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"4cb73da8-567c-4fca-b867-02b3bcf0c479\"><li>/terminaldev &lt;ID/Serial&gt;</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"cb7899c8-7ae0-4cb6-918d-f1c5f239207f\"><li>/payment &lt;Payment Intent Id&gt;</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"c5c70863-edb6-4517-a0f2-f6baf45a97bb\">The slackbot has been deployed to the Quilt slack instance.

This allows merchants to enter a social media page (Facebook, Instagram, etc) or business listing (Google MyBusiness, Yelp, etc) if they do not have a website.NOTE: For risk-related reasons, we should always encourage the merchant to enter a website if they have one.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(23).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ba2a5bb1-af9d-4f6c-8372-32c632000ce9\"><li>Payout Report - New IC+ Monthly Statement ⭐Added a new monthly statement export for merchants on Interchange Plus (IC+) pricing. This will appear on the Payouts report, under the summary data, after the 5th of the following month. The report includes more detailed fee information for merchants that need to reconcile their IC_ pricing.Attached is a screenshot of where the new export will be located on the Payouts Report and an example of what that exported data will look like.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/IC_Plus_Merchants_-_Monthly_Statement_-_Monthly_Report.csv\">IC Plus Merchants - Monthly Statement - Monthly Report.csv</a><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Monthly_Report_Export_(3).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"73fcb08b-0842-429e-8f11-6f4393bcd1ad\"><li>Donations - Fixed Donation Issues 🐞Fixed an issue that prevented donation settings from saving to the terminal.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"b669e66e-b711-4fd5-868f-2670f0a9ac7a\"><li>Interchange Plus (IC+) - Fixed an Issue w/ Fees on Refunded Transactions 🐞We fixed a small issue with refunds that resulted in IC+ merchants underpaying on their fees. We have since corrected this issue (no fees will be retroactively fixed so this will only affect new transactions).</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"cc67177e-7cb5-4b9c-9acb-c51e07582327\"><li>Payment Portal - Fixed Mobile Responsiveness 🐞Fixed an issue with the payment portal menus not showing correctly on smaller devices/screens.</li></ul>Mar 24 - Mar 30<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7288b882-77f2-49a8-9fd2-15fa5c503696\"><li>Payment Portal - Virtual Terminal Disabled by Default ⭐In our Payment Portal, there's a feature called the Virtual Terminal. It's meant for merchants to process sales if their POS fails or they need a quick alternative. Unfortunately, it been exploited by merchants who have tried, and sometimes succeeded, in using our Virtual Terminal to steal money from stolen cards. To reduce this risk, we've disabled it by default and set certain conditions to automatically enable it based on transaction history and merchant activity.If there are case by case situations where a merchant needs access to the Virtual Terminal before it's automatically enabled, you may reach out to Eric Saylor who can verify the merchant and enable it manually.NOTE: This will only affect newly created merchants. Accounts created prior to today will not be affected.In rare cases, if a merchant exhibits fraudulent behavior after going live, the Virtual Terminal may get disabled again until our Risk Team can preform a manual review of the merchant.KBA has been updated to reflect this change: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Payment-Portal-416f203eedf24ed68a6cc763137f24b2?pvs=21\">https://www.notion.so/quilt-payfac/Payment-Portal-416f203eedf24ed68a6cc763137f24b2?pvs=4#7a5a0984350447969499eb079039f7cc</a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a2bb54ff-a40d-4f23-91eb-0c313b24d5a1\"><li>Knowledgebase - NEW App Version Details ⭐To avoid confusion, and make things easier on our teams, we now display the current app version throughout the internal Notion knowledgebase. In addition, we added a new page called the '<a href=\"Hardware%20f64d20cb3422404a8dd0c6478601db00/Terminal%20App%20Release%20Schedule%20d1d91f50615744b0b1afc60237ffef5d.html\">Terminal App Release Schedule</a>' which will list previous app versions, the changes included as part of that change (we'll start recording this with 1.261 and onward), and more information about how we release terminal updates.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(17).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"cb4c7699-4bc0-416b-becf-ed76facf8b36\"><li>Email Alerts - Updated 'Welcome/Account Creation' Email ⭐We updated the Welcome/Account Creation email content based on feedback from our internal teams and from our merchants. The content now better highlights next steps and simplifies the overall process to create better efficiency and self-service.In addition, we've now broken out contact information in the footer allowing for Brands to insert different contact information for Support or Onboarding depending on their needs and processes.Also, for those unaware, this email can be resent if the merchant needs another copy or wants to send it to another person at their store. This can be done from the Profile page.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(76).png\"></a><a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Clipboard_2024-27-03_at_4.44.49_PM.png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"42469bbf-38af-4a07-8738-37b7a2f5eb16\"><li>Payout Report - Updated Payout Report for Interchange Plus Merchants ⭐Based on valuable feedback we received internally, we updated the Payout Report view for merchants on Interchange Plus pricing. This report now includes new columns such as 'Interchange Fees', 'Volume Fees', and 'Txn Fees' for easier reconciliation and reporting.We'll also be adding a detailed monthly statement they can export which will be coming soon.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(77).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d1ae2366-1441-4594-bc13-a1cb9fd14e9c\"><li>Payout Report - Removed 'In  Transit' Messaging ⭐Occasionally we will have situations in which funds will be paid out but the visual reconciliation of the Payouts Report will be delayed. In these scenarios we previously labeled the payout as 'In Transit' which was incorrect and led to Support requests. We now show the status as 'Completed' since the funds have been paid, but when the drop-down is selected it will display helpful text to better inform the merchant that the report is still being reconciled. We may continue to tweak the text but the intention here is to directly reduce calls and better inform the merchant. We are also planning on making some changes to reduce the frequency of reconciliation discrepancies causing this.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/image_(78).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"07942c7d-a764-419e-8c87-994dfed7d595\"><li>Permissions/Roles - Payout/Sweep Time Now Visible to all Users ⭐We found that the payout/sweep time was unintentionally hidden from most internal admins which led to people needing to reach out to team leads or supervisors for changes. We updated this field so now anyone can view and edit it. To view the Payout/Sweep time, go to the Profile page and click on the edit bank account icon.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e8b386ee-da53-44de-8e46-48ffaebb1fce\"><li>Onboarding Application - Plaid Integration ⭐As a quick final addition to the updates for the day, we have rolled Plaid out for all Rain Retail merchants. This will affect all net new merchants and any existing merchants with an application in the 'Created' status.Note: This is not live for all Brands. To help ensure a smooth release, we will be rolling out in batches similar to our Ring Deployment process for terminal app updates.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c1afe206-63eb-4288-b3aa-4df2f6ad3ffc\"><li>Login - Forgot Password Link Fixed 🐞We found and fixed and issue that resulted in the 'Forgot Password' link not working as intended.

That has since been resolved.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"df90b1a6-833e-46e9-bb1b-52d10b0d4d04\"><li>Onboarding Application - Upload Owner ID 🐞In some rare cases, restricted accounts in onboarding would be required to upload an identification document, such as a driver's license or passport, but the application would not allow it. This has been resolved.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f3696821-864e-498a-84c0-0c23755dcfcc\"><li>Onboarding Application - Bank Account Details not Displaying 🐞In a few recent examples, merchants added bank details while filling out the onboarding application however it would not show on the Summary page and caused an error. This issue has been resolved and now correctly displays. The bank details were also saved on the backend so no additional work is required from the merchant.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"872873b3-e7f1-44d3-8041-f17fdddd25ff\"><li>Payout Report - Incorrect Batch Times Displayed 🐞Some merchants experienced an issue in which the payout report time stamp would be displaying the wrong time. This resulted in payouts showing on the wrong date and causing other confusion with reconciliation. We discovered the cause was due to the time zone being passed incorrectly and has since been resolved.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"fd7e2831-da29-4285-9daa-c5e79a0cc0ff\"><li>Payment Portal - Payments Page Export Capped at 100 🐞The Payments Page on the Payment Portal shows transaction information for a given date range. The issue capped the export at 100 rows even if there were more transactions for that time period. We have increased that limit to 1,000 for efficiency and will monitor the impact.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ea27c4c1-6498-47ad-a9f7-b60da203c3d3\"><li>Payment Portal - User Permissions 🐞Fixed an issue with default user permissions for new merchant accounts that resulted in the wrong permissions being set.

This means that we can display the onboarding errors to the Onboarder/CSM in SFDC and build out future automatic notifications or other optimizations.NOTE: Even though we're now passing the data, CX &amp; SFDC leadership will still need to ingest the data and display it in the appropriate places within SFDC.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"aad28e86-030f-49a4-9224-31ac3b5d2b69\"><li>PayFac&lt;&gt;SFDC - Added Field for 'Salesforce Opportunity ID' ⭐Added a field on the Profile page of the Payment Portal for 'Salesforce Opportunity ID'. This allows CSMs/Onboarders to enter the SFDC Opp ID to more easily link accounts in SFDC with accounts in the Payment Portal. This information is passed to the datalake and allows us to create automatic notifications and other efficiencies.NOTE: Local leadership will work with teams on how/when to use this field.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Clipboard_2024-19-03_at_7.45.24_AM_(1).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"08cb85bf-dbe7-421b-aea6-1d7c83f8865b\"><li>Slackbot Release ⭐For those that missed it, we released a new Slack tool for our P5 terminal.

This prevented the application from being submitted since the user had no way to see or fix the second owner.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f5e94136-bbbf-4173-b845-3c04ffc0f11a\"><li>Create Account - Added Warning if new Account is Created Under Different Brand 🐞We found that accounts were mistakenly getting created under the wrong Brand. To reduce that possibility we added a new error message that warns the user they are creating an account under a different Brand than the one they are logged into.<a href=\"Weekly%20Release%20Notes%202024%20b9cc6405145f42d0bd1480971c1b48ea/Clipboard_2024-15-03_at_3.23.33_PM_(1).png\"></a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e4e7bdab-1a3b-4a65-a631-9b42c4503138\"><li>Payment Portal - Transactions Delayed Showing on the Payments Page 🐞We found instances where transactions were being delayed showing up on the Payment page.

Integrated payments is not required meaning as long as they’re an active customer with historical volume through the software, they may be able to qualify.

Parafin is an industry leading provider that offers flex loan products for businesses of any size. In fact, some of the largest platforms in the US offer flex loans to their users through Parafin:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"baa639b2-6563-4485-8395-a61e38463780\"><li>Well Funded San Francisco based Startup</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a0dd5054-0da8-4bc7-ba3e-d5f9767900d5\"><li>Founded by ex-Robinhood team</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7304f685-fdcd-4975-a924-09b6ae26e758\"><li>Parafin handles the day-to-day: After a merchant accepts their offer, Parafin handles everything from customer support to servicing and everything in between.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"29415d15-7109-441e-9610-377086ca07af\"><li>Providing Small business loans to Amazon Sellers, DoorDash, Mindbody and many other ISVs</li></ul><a href=\"Quilt%20Capital%20Flex%20Loan%20Program%205f194e1deb17418d9abbce6ec61969d3/Untitled%201.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"1c78042e-65e4-499a-a4b6-a16827de2882\">How it Works</h1><a href=\"Quilt%20Capital%20Flex%20Loan%20Program%205f194e1deb17418d9abbce6ec61969d3/Untitled%202.png\"></a><h3 class=\"\" id=\"c3e3f897-e93f-4027-9e64-373112828060\">The Process</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"ed504943-c2e8-4cf4-bc30-97a4fe0319e4\">Every day anonymized sales data is sent to Parafin using a unique merchant ID. Parafin uses the latest technology to pre-qualify merchants based on a variety of factors such as sales volume, refund rates, chargeback frequency, and more. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"7b0376ae-3433-4639-9e94-d55a3bc20002\">Once a merchant qualifies we start an automated campaign to send out a series of branded emails introducing the capital product and sending the merchant to a co-hosted landing page to sign up. Once interested, they’ll fill out a short form to indicate how much they need and which repayment length they want. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"d83e828a-d80d-488f-890e-3d797ef0e850\">From there, the merchant should receive funds within 1-2 business days. Repayment happens automatically based on a set percentage of their daily sales. This percentage depends on the loan amount and repayment terms. </p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"593cdb68-89d9-4c64-bb9e-f084db4e846d\">Branding</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"20a281ce-6dc4-4291-862b-adac92f91a26\">Each Brand’s flex loan program will be called [Brand] Capital (ex. Rain Capital). If the merchant has any questions or concerns, the Parafin team handles all of it- from the sales and onboarding to support and retention. Also, to create a consistent brand experience, their team will introduce themselves as the flex loan branch of the [Brand]. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"6b5e5824-5fc9-4c7d-8839-409ba190e9a5\">\n</p><p class=\"\" id=\"229ef597-9b8d-45be-bcba-560c41ecd28e\">\n</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"6a5673be-90ac-47ad-812f-972452eee6c5\">Customer Journey</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"5919d17c-4e7e-4698-b0e6-80d09227502e\">See the flowchart below for more detailed explanation of the customer experience:</p><a href=\"Quilt%20Capital%20Flex%20Loan%20Program%205f194e1deb17418d9abbce6ec61969d3/Untitled%203.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"ff6f17c7-a3fe-4507-8cc4-5106a27c44f3\">Customer Support Guide</h1><h2 class=\"\" id=\"4a47491a-fbe2-4bc7-8c9d-9dd525ffa4ea\">Overview</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"5b433837-fbd2-4af1-bcb6-79cc7ddaeee5\">Parafin will provide support to Quilt platforms and their business customers for the Quilt platforms and their capital programs.

For any other questions that relate to the specifics of the capital program or individual customer cases, the [Brand] should hand the inquiry off to the Parafin support team. This ensures that responses are accurate and follow compliance and regulatory requirements.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"fb0450c2-39a7-4b4f-99b8-1de5522e6c50\">If the customer reaches out via email/chat, the [Brand] can simply forward the ticket transcript over via the provided support email and it will trigger the priority SLA on Parafin’s end. If the customer reaches out by phone, the [Brand] support can complete this template including phone number.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"9f410a08-c3d8-4277-b3c7-3d5a36ff2d80\">Example Handoff Template for Quilt platforms to send to Parafin Support:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"729c2288-bf97-4989-a2fd-d890e192bc2d\"><li>To: [brand]-capital@parafin.com</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6e2c9407-197f-47b0-ae53-4ae694ec6aee\"><li>Customer name:</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c32b56e3-e6bf-4e30-8ea7-0ec83d592838\"><li>Customer contact info (phone/email):</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"cc2551e5-f6ad-46ba-9c49-ad6c422ce399\"><li>Business name:</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a4629928-72c8-4fdd-97c1-d60e6f1df8b7\"><li>Reason for contact:</li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"f42b511a-b41d-4323-b7a4-260b894a7e21\">Parafin Contact Information</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"3d4386a1-8183-4edc-a2f6-ed11d2a98857\">Parafin has decided support and sales staff dedicated to each brand we launch through them.

We wanted to alert you that your account was flagged this morning due to a large negative balance totaling (____).  Account balances operate on a ledger system. When a sale is made, the funds are credited to your processing account and then disbursed to your linked bank account.Conversely, when a chargeback or refund is issued, the funds are debited from your processing account. If there are not enough funds from sales to cover refunds/chargebacks, the result is a negative balance. Per the terms of your Payment Services Agreement with Rain, you are liable for any outstanding negative balances. If you have migrated to a new payment processor, we will need the balance to be resolved before we can close this account.To ensure your account is properly notated, please respond with the following:- An explanation for the sudden drop in sales volume. If you are planning to return to Rain, when do you expect sales to resume?-Estimated total sales volume, average ticket, and largest high ticket expected in the next 12 months.-If this is a migration, how many additional refunds are you expecting to issue? (depending on the volume, we may need you to set up blind/detached credits with your new payment processor).Due to the risks associated with keeping a dormant account open, we will need to close this account if you are not planning to resume processing in the next 2-3 days.Thanks for your cooperation.JacksonRisk Analyst&lt;Brand Details&gt;<p class=\"\" id=\"a56fc852-de77-44d3-92a5-d5bbc76f6d67\">\n</p><p class=\"\" id=\"20d8fd8d-472e-4ec8-8513-a88e171421ee\">\n</p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"21eb8799-dc88-4819-9647-59eeee39f866\">Chargeback</h3>Hello,I am a risk analyst with your payment processor &lt;Brand Name&gt;.

Whitelisting a domain is a cybersecurity strategy that approves sales from one website, while denying it on others. If you are seeing this error, it means that we have not approved that website. Below are the most common reasons for this:</p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"7f5f3bb0-1e50-43cc-93b3-7c9ccdcb8959\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>The merchant does not have a website with a valid SSL certification. We only whitelist the secure version of a merchant’s website so if the SSL certification has expired or was never purchased, they would not be able to process sales. Enabling an SSL should resolve the issue. Ex: http://www.mywebsite.com would not work but https://www.mywebsite.com would work.</li></ol><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"1102dc80-9f56-4b48-ab2c-faddc7cf311f\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>If this is appearing for manual card entry, it is possible that the merchant’s IP address was not whitelisted.

In this article, we will outline a step-by-step guide to help identify merchant fraud while onboarding.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"00a6ebca-1125-4a9c-a905-95648b85b5cf\">Step 1: Check SFDC Address</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"9d7d3af7-b6e6-4ec4-ac91-fadd66ece01a\">Many fraudsters won’t have a real address to use when signing up so they’ll often provide a residential address which is easier to fake than a commercial one. This is an easy way to catch potential fraudsters and is an early red flag.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"d7865e30-0607-48d2-86bd-ffc1565359fb\">Look at the supplied address in SFDC on Google Maps to see if it looks residential or commercial. If it looks residential, then please email <a href=\"mailto:risk@quiltsoftware.com\">risk@quiltsoftware.com</a> with their Business Name and SFDC link for further investigation.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"a719a238-5038-4e46-bd20-8d92d3d26935\">Step 2: Collect Customer Information</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"5f36dd61-bf9a-4a35-b4e5-01f79c13151c\">During the onboarding process, ensure that you gather detailed information about the merchant. Much of this should be done from the AE during the sales process but some will be dependent on you during onboarding. Before a customer goes live, we should make sure their business information in the POS software matches what’s listed in SFDC.</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"52ff47a8-98fb-40aa-bf58-572731cb136a\"><li>Business Name</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"cec66781-5868-46e6-9ec1-f0ef2960555f\"><li>Physical Address</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"fd7f42ce-967f-44c7-894f-6730c06a09cb\"><li>Website</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f5c5d462-3a52-486c-9396-123de686a128\"><li>Phone Number</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"73b5f761-c9e4-4363-a45a-69c14b7504c9\"><li>Administrator in SFDC is the same as the Docusign Signee</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"350fa908-eeef-41d8-a948-e83a62cffe9f\">If any of this information in POS software doesn’t match SFDC or is missing from SFDC then please email <a href=\"mailto:risk@quiltsoftware.com\">risk@quiltsoftware.com</a> with their Business Name and SFDC link for further investigation.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"1c10bbec-ff25-436b-874f-fcd73ebcc3bd\">Step 3: Assess Online Presence</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"3332429c-21ed-4b75-998c-061ebe03ab21\">Once you have collected the necessary information, verify the legitimacy of the merchant's business by checking to make sure they have one or more of the following:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"c88e44af-e5eb-4ea6-b7f7-20e70fa414f7\"><li>Website</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e4f47897-2496-444e-8c2f-d310a696e9f0\"><li>Social media profiles</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6c98f678-53b9-44ff-8ec1-5d0de3384810\"><li>Business listings (Google, Yelp, etc.)</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"2bc3ffcc-ad50-47d9-8b7c-d366e2876ec0\">The goal here is to make sure they have an established presence as scammers typically won’t go through the effort of creating such extensive backgrounds. Brand new businesses may not have any of these yet in which case you should refer to the next step.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"c084c585-ae07-4010-b7bc-20773edb30eb\">Step 4: Identify Suspicious Activity (”Gut Check”)</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"eb5fea0f-7781-481f-a329-8d694fc91d6d\">Asking general questions about how the customer plans to operate their business can help you better understand their use-case and uncover important information that may help us identify them as a fraudster. Here are some examples of things that may be suspicious:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7f4bd557-3444-4c63-997b-29ad89632383\"><li>They are too eager to get started and rush the process</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f37ee1a5-f0c5-47aa-bc68-66d3a9e86713\"><li>They are a new business and are not interested in establishing an online presence</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"80f131d1-4219-4c5d-a3f9-761d333bf6ab\"><li>They don’t have billing information listed in SFDC or are behind on their payments</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6fff5dfc-5186-4dee-9eaf-b21e952db8a2\"><li>They inform you they plan to use primarily manual entry or cash</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"bdfe92ab-dc50-495d-86a8-b0701fc057d8\"><li>They are unwilling to provide social security number, bank details, or other sensitive information to proceed with integrated payments</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"48e360d2-0217-44a9-a235-840120316d05\"><li>They plan to market/sell only via word-of-mouth and social media</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"dedcf15e-f787-491f-985d-1b8d2a96edea\"><li>The business address is a residential address</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"97b7d44a-0105-43ca-8348-ea35d4fd4b12\">One recent trend we’ve noticed is that fraudsters seem to commonly be using one or more of these email domains:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1dc6ed2f-1f16-4207-93e9-a3626a19e5e6\"><li>mail.com</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7d8c327d-d209-47fa-8ff4-80c4e09f2aec\"><li>protonmail.com</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ff430a3d-3827-419d-8316-7481706d9baf\"><li>and mmail.biz</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"0b15042e-dc92-40d9-8760-408aabe0c6eb\">If you come across an account with this email address, please immediately report them.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"7de8eebf-30bf-4796-aee3-78477c33991a\">Conclusion</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"cf32687a-1b17-4af0-a18a-894958367665\">Identifying merchant fraud requires a comprehensive approach that combines thorough verification and fraud detection tools.

Instead of manual entry or file uploads, Plaid enables a smoother onboarding experience by automating the verification of bank account details, income, and transaction history. This not only reduces friction in the onboarding process but also enhances accuracy and security. Overall, Plaid integration simplifies the verification of financial information, making it more efficient for merchants and improving the overall user experience.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"da0832c3-59ea-4e8f-b652-042c5daf69c0\">Plaid supports over 12,000 financial institutions and is used by some of the largest brands in the US, including:</p><a href=\"Plaid%20Integration%20101a6cba168c4a809870938a98c6f218/Untitled%201.png\"></a><p class=\"\" id=\"5108c00c-3ddc-4fcc-b1df-5e493d2c368e\">\n</p>💡Note: Plaid is only supported for merchants onboarding through Adyen- Stripe merchants will be unaffected by this update.<h1 class=\"\" id=\"152d26c4-b68a-469a-9189-47a2ea43b00b\">Affected Merchants</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"1e8690d3-7700-41cc-a36a-1eb65bddcf37\">This integration affects only US-Based merchants onboarding through Adyen, and focuses specifically on bank verification. The process for verifying identities and business details is not affected by this change. Merchants in Canada and other countries will operate like normal through the existing process. </p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"fb60cade-f8a6-4ca7-87f8-89286cf5a1d3\">Why only US?</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"a336a919-9b67-4a3e-a5d6-b770f0d98fe2\">For merchants outside the United States, we use a tool called <a href=\"https://giact.com/\">GIACT</a> which provides bank verification services primarily for those operating internationally. Historically, we’ve seen the biggest issues around bank verification for smaller credit unions and banks within the US which GIACT does not have great coverage for. Plaid specializes in the US and includes smaller institutions other services may not typically service. Supporting both services should give us the widest range of automatic bank verification.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"e2566952-07da-4ec9-ac22-7d7084d7a560\">Process</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"bad73921-2d68-4e90-ace0-b7af81a74684\">When a merchant nears the end of the onboarding application, it asks them to add their bank details for payouts.

Once found, the bank’s logo can be clicked on, which will open a new secure window from their bank asking for the user’s username and password. If Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) is turned on then it will require a PIN to be entered before proceeding. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"1d63930f-2129-43d3-be7f-6fa9e3198b00\">Once fully logged in, the window will display a list of the accounts associated with that user’s bank credentials.

The merchant will be presented with the option to choose which file they would like to upload (bank statement, voided check, screenshot of online bank portal, etc) and then shown the requirements that file has to meet before uploading. If the file is uploaded and it does not meet those requirements then it will fail and require the user to upload again which can take up to 24 hours each time. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"4abcd8eb-b6f5-404b-b488-2eab172432d6\">\n</p><a href=\"Plaid%20Integration%20101a6cba168c4a809870938a98c6f218/cinnamon-2024-01-12T1843000100.webm\">https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a2eac450-ca50-4632-b656-7d30a3a195b1/bb857f64-dc20-481e-b4e6-b1d01b70f908/cinnamon-2024-01-12T1843000100.webm</a><p class=\"\" id=\"61dd5af5-cf25-4579-a911-c8f3db4128ee\">\n</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"c73b968e-f975-4012-b6c5-760e9f9ffccc\">FAQ</h1><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"b819cf92-55fa-406d-a3c7-5254081b4aa9\"><li>What if the bank is missing from the list?</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"198fd213-ba57-4dfa-8aa9-9e2bc9c71a71\"><li>What if the merchant is concerned about security of adding their bank account?</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"2ec98543-410d-4558-890c-f44789827a73\"><li>Merchant doesn’t know username and password? </li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"36df7b2f-ee82-4762-953c-6686777c1a07\">\n</p>",

With IC+ there are hundreds of fees a merchant may pay at any given time whereas with Flat Rate, it’s much simpler. Instead, the merchant will pay one of three potential rates:<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e014c65f-3dee-484c-8133-43b791375472\"><li>Card Present. Unless the merchant received a custom rate, this is generally something like 2.80% + $0.10 (rates may vary across Brand).</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"5c60003e-c9fa-4c74-a2fe-450a7e5b9d0b\"><li>Card not Present.

American Express (AMEX) charges more than most of the other card brands and so the extra costs have to be passed on. Generally this means the merchant pays .49% on top of their Card Present or Card Not Present rates. </li></ul></p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"780978c8-9635-40ab-aa39-08b5f81525d3\">Fee and Rate Locations</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"9f1f2cdd-e38b-43e3-a169-184c39dc1974\">Their current rates can be seen under the ‘Transactions Rate’ section in the Profile page of merchants that have been set up to utilize Flat Rate.

This shouldn’t be something we go out of our way to advertise but it’s important to understand how it works in case it’s asked.<h1 class=\"\" id=\"862cc19f-2fd8-49a5-89e5-3adbdd830cd2\">IC+ Fees</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"f0106885-61af-44af-8f97-18f3d9b4cacc\">With IC+, we still charge a volume fee and a per transaction fee but it’s in addition to whatever interchange fees are assessed. Interchange and assessment fees are the costs the card brands charge for processing the transaction. IC+ is where we pass along those fees directly to the merchant and add a small margin on top to remain profitable. There is an additional Interchange fee that we pass on which is applied monthly to a merchants account, this is typically a small fee between $2 and $10.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"748cabd9-6e2c-4eb4-9dbd-57deeab51cb2\">Example: If a merchant processed a $100 transaction, the interchange fees may be around $1.90. If we charge an IC+ rate of .10% + $0.05 then our fees would be another $0.15 which would mean the total cost to the merchant would be $2.05</p><p class=\"\" id=\"99847ffc-4868-4629-9474-15a5aeac9c94\">For IC+ merchants, processing fees are taken out of each transaction before they’re deposited.

That means if the card declines 5 times before it succeeded, the merchant would only pay the fees once on the captured payment. With IC+, the fees are charged on the authorization which means if the card declined 5 times before it succeeded, the merchant would pay the per transaction fee on all 5 attempts before paying the interchange, volume fee, and per transaction fee. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"afc27d31-6437-4a3c-b27a-01391481578f\">Monthly Summary</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"216a5d7b-1268-446e-9c1c-2ab18a1c99a6\">IC+ pricing is more complex than other pricing models and so additional reports are often needed to help merchants reconcile. The Monthly Summary report is available on the Payouts page, under the summary data. A new monthly summary is generated after the 5th of each month for the prior month’s data. Merchants can download the export at any time by pressing the ‘Download CSV’ button next to the month they’re interested in. </p><a href=\"Interchange%20Plus%20(IC+)%20247c5c1c6cd14e2e9933120e20c4ae5d/d48a835e-9008-43c1-93c1-1234587b55ff.png\"></a><h2 class=\"\" id=\"45fcc398-745f-42cd-9345-b30cf8554c70\">Export File</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"1243f780-b21e-4555-b334-0bef9e741a62\">The export includes a section at the top which displays the Merchant’s Name, MID, and summary information of the month’s sales data. Below that section is where their sales are displayed by day and a more comprehensive breakout of their fees are shown. An example of the export can be found below:</p><a href=\"Interchange%20Plus%20(IC+)%20247c5c1c6cd14e2e9933120e20c4ae5d/Screenshot_2024-07-15_083323.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"3283ba91-5b59-4712-aff0-98c7a6e83c70\">Refunds</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"4bcdef69-cb7f-4276-a486-5ec6d2f41529\">Generally with Flat Rate and Cash Discounting, fees are paid when the payment is captured. In those scenarios, if it’s later refunded, no additional fees are charged however IC+ works differently. With an IC+ refund, the merchant pays the original fees when capturing the payment and then a smaller amount in addition when refunding it. The fees charged on the refund is the per transaction fee listed in their fee agreement. </p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"613388b3-5d1f-47f8-b390-19cdccf112a2\"><li>Example: If a merchant processed a $100 transaction, the interchange fees may be around $1.90. If we charge an IC+ rate of .10% + $0.05 then our fees would be another $0.15 which would mean the total cost to the merchant would be $2.05. If they then refunded that transaction, they would pay another $0.05 bringing their total cost to $2.10.</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"9896deb0-d65c-4ed3-8fdd-e4b2616003cd\">\n</p>",

Something that is very critical to note is that the exact order of things matters. So if you have tried some of the steps or have done them out of order, then you need to go through the troubleshooting steps again in the exact order. Use the section below to complete steps before moving on to more advanced troubleshooting.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"dd0d7a20-f65a-4c96-b50e-4949abe45415\">Power Off/On Again</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"2ea28092-2e96-4370-8eff-4d0da615b4fc\">Sometimes turning a device off/on again can clear the device cache, install pending system updates, and do other magic troubleshooting things. This should always be the first step:</p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"792d3b6c-c38b-4853-8157-cba015c9f668\">Adyen</h3><a href=\"P5%20Credit%20Card%20Reader%2040c45bbf30264deebd2550d4702f52df.html\">P5 Credit Card Reader</a><a href=\"S1F2%20Credit%20Card%20Reader%208484795356c24788adaa7ca6afa87bcf.html\">S1F2 Credit Card Reader</a><h3 class=\"\" id=\"8c26a4c8-0b0a-4de5-a51a-fe6b562b6993\">Stripe</h3><a href=\"WisePOS%20E%20Card%20Reader%20d74b6d2366224198b36ae5653d4d7000.html\">WisePOS E Card Reader</a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"de808e9e-058d-47e3-8b72-ac32f83b177a\">Make Sure the Account is Enabled</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"d53acf01-c14a-4beb-a42f-204adabc41d1\">In order to process transactions, the account needs to be fully setup and approved.

Poor network connections can cause issues such as transaction delays, failed payments, and security vulnerabilities. Ensuring a robust network helps prevent these problems, providing a seamless and secure transaction experience for both merchants and customers.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"3233029f-4108-4089-aea6-94bf397d5fc6\">Terminal Network Requirements</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"49b36233-ea6e-482d-9fba-1343af178b78\">Minimum requirement for network speed for a single device on a network is 5Mbps, for updates a faster connection is needed, typically around 10 to 15 Mbps, this allows the update to run and complete with the least amount of downtime and download issues. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"4ac88d88-8d31-436f-9e13-2b11b5b6d46f\">Recommended terminal speed is 25Mbps or greater at the terminal. </p>💡Note: These network speeds are for a single device being the only piece of equipment that is using the internet connection, if there are other computers, printers, etc. on the network the speeds will need to be greater to account for the traffic💡Note: ISP’s today typically supply speeds anywhere between 25Mbps all the way up to 10Gbps. The speeds that are available depend on the ISP, what is available in the location, and what the merchant has contracted to receive. With everything that is using the internet and constantly updating today, a small business should have 250Mbps minimum to be able to conduct business effectively.<h2 class=\"\" id=\"4247cd1e-40bb-47fc-8f30-624927a8345a\">Test Network Speed</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"b3be195e-4916-4be9-8cd8-6a805f25dca5\">To test the ISP speed, run a speed test from a device that is connected using an ethernet cord (Physically connected to the internet) this will give the actual speed of the network that includes the Modem, Router, and what the ISP is providing, Run the same test from another device that is using the Wi-Fi connection for the speed of the Wi-Fi that is set up in the merchants facility this can be done using a phone, or tablet. This will also allow the client to run the test in different locations around their storefront/office location to see if there are dead zones in their Wi-Fi coverage they need to be aware of.</p>Here are a couple of sites that provide a free and reliable speed test:<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"5a1fdfa9-75b8-4722-966c-d02994540fb1\"><li><a href=\"https://fast.com/\">https://fast.com/</a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"30cd914f-1cc7-417f-903f-d97b62d47dab\"><li><a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/speedtest/\">https://fiber.google.com/speedtest/</a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6445e359-0396-45e2-b5d2-27754db7d9e2\"><li><a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">https://www.speedtest.net/</a></li></ul><h3 class=\"\" id=\"d21635f2-1b3f-446e-9b54-3ba8b05a824c\">Typical Hotspot Speeds</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"2c7a1661-ab7d-43ee-a5cc-a14290c3e7c2\">A typical 4G hotspot can provide speeds up to 49Mbps in an ideal setting, and 5G can provide connectivity as high as 114Mbps in an ideal setting. So in real world application you can expect a little over half of that speed. Anything else that is utilizing bandwidth on the network will slow this speed, this can be programs or apps that are constantly looking for updates, like a weather app on your phone, or a PC that is connected to a network and is being used to browse the internet or update documents on a cloud drive.</p>💡Note: The hotspot speeds listed above are for the dedicated hotspot connection device, not the hotspot that is available in most cell phones. Hotspot available on phones has a very large variation range based on phone type, phone plan provider, signal strength, and number of apps that are continuously using the bandwidth for constant updates. Using phone hotspots will work for a short term connection at an event, it is not advisable to use a phone hotspot as a long term connection solution.<h3 class=\"\" id=\"531dcd2c-ca3b-4354-8e69-27199a87c9a9\">Speeds Below Minimum Threshold</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"fb781fcb-81e7-4440-84c7-85a75b8a6434\">If their network does not meet the minimum requirements, here are a few things to look at that may help:</p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"f9c83901-0e94-4eaa-83ab-fee8061ee4ed\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>If possible connect the terminal using a hard wire connection either using a <a href=\"P5%20Ethernet%20Cradle%208a6c5d8fad274227bbd819c9fda091ea.html\">Cradle</a>, or an Ethernet adapter.</li></ol><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"5a667c69-7039-400c-b705-ad603deff5b6\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>Locate the router that is providing the Wi-Fi coverage for the location, and move the terminal physically closer to this router and run the speed checks again.

In these scenarios, the terminal is usually otherwise undamaged and just needs a working battery. If this is the case, please visually inspect the charging port to see if appears to be intact. Sometimes the charging port can become loose over time if handled too roughly. If this is the case, the entire terminal will need to be replaced and the normal <a href=\"RMA%20Process%2081f032aa0ee04f239df9db22d95014a7.html\">RMA procedure</a> should be followed.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"635df817-66b8-48fb-8e75-93574fd1bfdb\">If the charging port and the rest of the terminal appears undamaged then a full RMA is not needed and we can just replace the battery. Please use the <a href=\"P5%20Terminal%20Battery%20bab8e18209b443c89e7484b2e196230f.html\">Battery Replacement</a> article to submit a request for a new battery.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"d9ce8b24-d925-4740-a04b-d67e7d56efe0\">Submit RMA Ticket</h1>💡In 90% of cases so far, the terminal issues have been resolved with the above steps so if you get to this point and the issue persists, please ensure you have double checked everything. It’s also worth pointing out that it’s often easier to trust the customer went through certain steps or followed basic instructions rather than confirming they’ve actually done those things- the best advice here is to trust but validate. If you’ve asked a merchant to update the time zone on their device and they are still running into the same issue, it may help to get a screenshot of the settings page to ensure they’ve updated the right section. Or if a merchant’s receipt is printing blank, it may be helpful to have them take a quick video on their cell phone to show that the paper was inserted the correct way. <p class=\"\" id=\"213a40f2-f328-44f3-8357-ee4267eb67ad\">If the problem continues then the best course of action at this point is to see if the terminal is eligible for an RMA. To do this, check when the device was ordered and, if it was within 6 months of the current date, then please submit an RMA Ticket (this just helps us record repeat issues and troubleshooting steps taken). If the device was ordered more than 6 months ago then the warranty is no longer valid and the merchant will need to purchase a new terminal. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"de71133d-e467-4b5c-97cc-3e4452f3ff31\"><a href=\"https://payfac.quiltsoftware.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=rma\">C</a><a href=\"https://payfac.quiltsoftware.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=rma\">lick Here</a> to submit the RMA Ticket</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"95a8612e-0372-4a58-927d-39da90abc772\"><li>To ensure the best success, please make sure that the troubleshooting steps attempted were clearly outlined.</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"b6cc9e73-7fbf-4bf4-b715-33219ca584ab\">Once the RMA Ticket has been submitted, please proceed to the next step.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"67905c36-9516-4730-b87a-d361b6359f95\">Submit RMA Case in Salesforce (SFDC)</h1>💡Occasionally a member of the Quilt PayFac team may reach out over Slack with additional questions before a replacement is ordered.

In these scenarios, the terminal is usually otherwise undamaged and just needs a working battery.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"08e62787-35f4-4d7a-b3d7-7ded8e4ecbef\">Check the Warranty</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"13673ff3-aeb5-4914-bcc9-5a7edbcf448a\">Generally, our hardware warranty covers any replacements or repairs for up to 6 months from the purchase date. If the issue occurs within that time period and needs to be replaced then we can do so free of charge. If not then the merchant will have to purchase it at full price. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"b68400d5-4001-4e37-8599-8f2f2bbf98d0\">Physically Inspect Battery</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"c7597b35-cf02-4784-bc05-66dd9a597b47\">Before placing an order for a new battery, please visually inspect the charging port to see if appears to be intact. Sometimes the charging port can become loose over time if handled too roughly. If this is the case, the entire terminal will need to be replaced and the normal <a href=\"RMA%20Process%2081f032aa0ee04f239df9db22d95014a7.html\">RMA procedure</a> should be followed.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"e36f5107-7935-4b2f-9f9d-27aa500ba49b\">If the charging port and the rest of the terminal appears undamaged then a full RMA is not needed and we can just order a new battery. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"111cf62f-9ea4-47c1-bb41-d1649434a55c\">Ordering New Batteries</h1><h2 class=\"\" id=\"22e4cc16-4fa1-4f52-aa1b-cf6e30bce700\">Battery Price</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"67ec5449-b9d4-4adc-b890-0115f0f776f7\">If a merchant needs to purchase a new battery outside of the warranty period, the retail price is $40 USD and $54 CAD. </p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"a1c94a8b-1cd0-45f7-bd84-35e300a2aceb\">SFDC Ordering Process</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"d53ff899-23cd-4b20-9d5d-da5e82e7b37b\">Ordering new batteries is the same process as ordering new P5 terminals.

There are several reasons for this but at the very least, it’s in the merchant’s best interest to process transactions over that amount since most stores will pay a minimum of $0.11 per transaction plus other built-in costs like rent, salary, utilities, etc would mean anything less and they’d lose money on that sale.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"cb954e6f-241c-482a-85de-3ebd3411579a\">If the amount they are trying to process is less than $0.50 they will have to process an amount more than that for it to go through.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"29ca48d5-33ae-4741-96b9-aa2ab7ccfa9e\">Supported Payments Methods</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"1f142030-7d5d-4444-b13b-66a5f4f96886\">We support most major payment methods however some card types we may not currently support or may be in development.

It advises users to ensure devices are properly paired, and that both ROM and app versions are up to date, while also highlighting the importance of transaction minimums and supported payment methods. For high-risk transactions, it suggests merchants may be notified via email, and if issues persist, users are directed to initiate a replacement or return process."

It involves entering card details manually, either through a terminal or a secure web component. This method is considered high-risk and can incur higher interchange fees. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"fbee4fa7-4d4f-417c-aec7-58f060dd9cad\">Manual Entry is generally used to process two types of transactions:</p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"9c0da149-bac4-42fd-a6a1-33bb1f2210ce\">Over the phone</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"d303a544-23a4-454f-9c12-9dbe61f0aab6\">These types of orders can be a profitable and convenient method of taking payments especially in industries where it’s more standard practice such as the Framing/Art space or those selling wholesale. Sometimes these industries don’t have ecommerce websites where they sell traditional products and they can’t accept cash or check remotely so any order that needs to be shipped usually has their payment done over the phone. </p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"b123da4d-e3b1-4b28-b98a-8c970a6bc910\">Transactions without a terminal</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"f1e0a1a0-a53c-4e67-b072-ef23ff4aaa84\">Manual entry is also very common with service/repair industries where the technicians may be on-site with customers and do not have access to a computer or credit card terminal. Generally in these industries, a tablet or smart device is used to accept a deposit/payment before the full invoice is generated at the store for payment. In these scenarios, it’s not uncommon for the card to be tokenized for later use. </p>💡Note: In rare cases, the Virtual Terminal may also be used to process Manual Entry transactions however this is primarily intended if the point-of-sale (POS) goes down or is otherwise inaccessible. <h1 class=\"\" id=\"3ca81175-db7f-4eda-b5bf-e742a83dc61b\">Availability</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"1ae1258b-8c12-48f5-9042-ad05b4320481\">Some features, Manual Entry, are available on the PayFac but may not be available to all Brands.

Even if the card is physically present and used to enter the card details, because it’s not tapped, inserted, or swiped, there’s no way for the card brands to know if it was physically present at the time of the transaction. This type of transaction is also considered High-Risk which means that interchange can potentially be significantly higher than a Card Present or even other Card Not Present transactions. For Flat Rate merchants this won’t matter but for anyone on IC+, they should expect to pay more for these types of transactions. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"3d48349f-c748-4f64-8dde-18e08a01fa7c\">Manual Entry can be done one of two ways which depends on the capabilities and/or limitations of the POS.</p><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"ee6ce743-ee3b-4379-b531-ea41cad7ab1c\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\"><li>Through the terminal. In some cases, manual entry may be done through the credit card reader. The way this works is the POS will have a button in the register that says something like ‘Manual Entry’. When this is pressed instead of the normal transaction flow on the device, it will show fields to manually enter the card details including the associated zip code. </li></ol><a href=\"Manual%20Entry%20b375db28852a4d5cb3219502dc9c689c/Clipboard_2023-21-08_at_9.54.07_AM_(1).png\"></a><ol class=\"numbered-list\" id=\"cfb8a119-d45a-474d-96a3-494655125fca\" start=\"2\" type=\"1\"><li>Web Component. The recommended approach, when possible, is to do manual entry through the point-of-sale (POS) using the PayFac’s secure web component. With this method, the clerk starts the transaction and selects something like ‘Manual Entry’ and instead of it going to the terminal, secure fields are available for the clerk to enter the card details directly through the POS. This is the more secure route since it doesn’t allow potential fraudsters to use the terminal directly and instead the clerk is responsible for entering the information. This is also the more streamlined process since the clerk doesn’t have to turn the terminal around to enter the details or have the shopper enter the card information themselves.</li></ol><a href=\"Manual%20Entry%20b375db28852a4d5cb3219502dc9c689c/Untitled.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"ec841113-1bd2-4397-b94e-71d67b92d76c\">Risk</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"8100d7aa-28ba-4dbe-ad57-a790dd3bf2a4\">The below is additional information about the risk involved when using manual entry:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"2eb3b12d-39b5-4495-865b-411a2a6409db\"><li>Increased Fraud Risk: Manual entry transactions are more susceptible to fraud. Since the card information is manually entered rather than swiped, dipped, or tapped, there's a higher likelihood that the transaction could involve stolen card information.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0a2bb22b-894f-4ca1-b419-a48fd075f789\"><li>Lack of Evidence: In manual entry transactions, there's typically less evidence to prove the legitimacy of the transaction. For example, with an in-store transaction, merchants can provide signed receipts or security camera footage. For e-commerce transactions, merchants can provide digital records such as IP addresses, email correspondence, and delivery confirmation. Manual entry transactions often lack these forms of verifiable evidence.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"5d0aad72-be88-492d-9ab5-1094db07ef88\"><li>Higher Chargeback Rates: Manual entry transactions tend to have higher chargeback rates due to the reasons mentioned above. Higher chargeback rates can make it more challenging for merchants to win disputes, as banks and card issuers often view these transactions with greater suspicion.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"17b5d496-6b71-4f9c-97d5-d005d743cd36\"><li>Regulations and Policies: Payment processors and card networks may have stricter rules and regulations for manual entry transactions, which can make it harder for merchants to win disputes. These rules are in place to protect against the higher risk of fraud associated with these types of transactions.</li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"389a3eb1-a686-4aac-ab67-58274c260677\">Additional Information</h1><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"eceb4921-7468-4884-90ea-61a7b966f08e\"><li>For those more familiar with Payments or the risk involved in manual transactions, there are technically two names for manual entry transactions. While not commonly used by merchants, it may come up so it’s good to know and understand what they refer to. <ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7f121440-b07d-4cff-8405-4b9955afc3a1\"><li>MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone Order): MOTO transactions involve accepting credit card payments when the cardholder is not physically present.

This is more common in the scenarios described where a terminal is generally not present. This can also occur if the terminal is present but the card or device is damaged. </li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"64c1af44-0e51-40ab-98f4-2e77d6713f91\"><li>Manual Entry transactions can be tokenized and work the same way as any other tokenized card.</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"619e4154-cc7f-4f78-a06d-5c5562f217c9\">\n</p>",

Its primary purpose is intended as a backup if the POS goes down or is otherwise inaccessible. This can be a good selling point for merchants who are on the road, have computer issues and want a backup, or if they have remote teams that need to be able to enter payments but may not have access to the POS. This last point is more common for on-prem POS solutions where the software has to be locally installed and remote employees may not be able to install it on their computer.</p>💡Note: This page is disabled by default for new merchants and will automatically be enabled once certain conditions are met through consistent sales activity, usually within the first 30 days after activation.

This usually has an error code of something like ‘Declined. Suspected Fraud’. When this happens, it means one of our risk rules were triggered and/or we received information from the card issuer about that card. In some cases, the merchant may still want to accept such transactions, while it is technically possible, we strongly discourage that behavior since it introduces additional risk to us and the merchant. </li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"e7907f2d-c254-4c17-8860-0f8e9b18a992\">\n</p>",

You cannot capture an amount more than what was originally authorized but you can capture less than the original amount. This sometimes happens if a merchant can fulfill some of the order but not all of it. Once any of the funds have been captured, the merchant cannot capture more later (ex. merchant has a $100 order and wants to capture $50 now and $50 later). </p><p class=\"\" id=\"68bc3de4-a792-44a0-968c-bd6a96a3ea67\">Some merchants/industries do auto-capture where the funds are captured immediately upon checkout. Others prefer to only authorize the funds and capture the money once they are ready to fulfill the order. This is usually more prevalent in industries where inventory is more scarce and online orders may not always be able to get fulfilled fully or where special orders may need to be placed by the merchant before fulfilling. Auto-capture is usually discouraged by most card brands to help protect against disputes although it’s not strictly against any regulations. We support both methods and the capture settings are usually configured within the Brand’s POS/eComm software platform.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"143f814d-1a83-4a03-b5d4-9c9151f2c0d8\">Fees</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"81ada4bb-a3a8-4083-a740-a3a4366945c9\">eCommerce transactions are considered Card Not Present (CNP) and usually has a higher rate for the Flat Rate and Interchange Plus (IC+) pricing models. Just like with Card Present, the rates can be negotiated with higher volume but this is much rarer with Card Not Present due to the need of having significant online volume. For IC+ pricing, interchange is also higher so the merchant pays more to us and more for interchange. </p><a href=\"eCommerce%20aa215e4a2b8e479e9414608b9d426f34/Screenshot_2024-07-15_101359.png\"></a><a href=\"eCommerce%20aa215e4a2b8e479e9414608b9d426f34/Screenshot_2024-07-15_101542.png\"></a>💡Note: Cash Discounting pricing model is not supported with eCommerce since cash is not an available payment method online. <h1 class=\"\" id=\"ed82a287-5154-4c82-9702-f1c683bc7fc7\">Options Available</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"efe579d8-5b7b-45ca-aa89-172d4bb84037\">Below are some of the more popular options that are available for the eCommerce feature:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"33b703a8-b343-4bc7-85e1-f314b68314c5\"><li>eCommerce transactions can also be tokenized if supported through the Brand’s POS/eComm solution.

In fact, in 2023, losses due to ecommerce fraud were projected to exceed $48 billion (<a href=\"https://b2b.mastercard.com/news-and-insights/blog/ecommerce-fraud-trends-and-statistics-merchants-need-to-know-in-2024/\">Mastercard</a>) (<a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/ecommerce-fraud-prevention\">Shopify</a>). This has become especially prevalent since Covid where fraud skyrocketed. Because of this, merchants processing online have to ensure they’re using processors who have extensive fraud protection included. Some services charge a premium for this service or even shipping and chargeback insurance. With us, we have extensive fraud protection and transaction monitoring that protects the merchant from even knowing fraud was attempted. </p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Global-Fraud-Protection-047fb5e44d764791b7a90b4660887bbc?pvs=21\">Global Fraud Protection</a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"d9f651ea-c372-4936-9afa-0804528e432a\">Payout</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"357b2ad2-655e-4dfa-8f45-b7c811753072\">eCommerce transactions can be found on the Payments and Payout pages just like Card Present transactions.

With our payments offering, we allow Split Payments which is where a retailer can split one transaction across multiple cards.

Offering flexible payment options like this is a great way to accept increase revenue for sales that otherwise might not have happened.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"71f1572f-1653-4a0d-b617-28b9d72f2e8f\">Availability</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"cc18d82b-c77b-4925-86d8-3d22d7e59ab5\">Some features, like Split Payments, are available on the PayFac but may not be available to all Brands.

The point-of-sale (POS) will send over the first amount with the transaction ID to the terminal. The shopper will tap/insert their card and then the clerk should be notified it was successful, then the clerk will send over the second amount and the process repeats. On the POS side, this should show as one transaction with multiple cards. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"d971baa7-7c02-4044-b4f2-3efa1988f40f\">While the POS will show one transaction with multiple cards, the Payment Portal will show multiple payments- all with unique payment ID’s and the same transaction ID. Transaction ID’s are used to identify a transaction within the point-of-sale (POS) or ecommerce platform while the payment intent is the unique identifier tied to the charge with the processor. Both the transaction ID and the payment intent can be found on the Payments page.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"e30fc5c9-bef5-45dc-b775-167f8c9eb4b0\">Each charge will show up in its own row on the Payments page and its own row on the Payout report. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"b7f832c7-2d77-4f0e-9e26-60192267d067\">Additional Details</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"e73cbc9d-4b85-4fa1-a38d-6d72c7cadda7\">While split payments is a revenue driver, and does mean the merchant will get additional sales they may not have otherwise, it is slightly more expensive. We should not go out of our way to advertise this but if asked, it’s important to understand how the pricing works. Fees are charged on each payment, not on the transaction as a whole.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"513663ec-5eb5-4585-8e31-b73f80929c03\">Ex: If a merchant splits a $90 transaction into three equal payments of $30 each, and their rates are 2.80% + $0.10, then they will pay $0.94 on each payment for a total of $2.82 in fees. Had they done a single payment instead, they would have paid $2.62 in fees. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"62b3d705-6d64-4a58-9d8a-1bea4ba89fd1\">\n</p>",

The process involves handling each payment separately while maintaining a unified transaction ID, making it seamless for both merchants and customers."

On the opposite side, some newer processors are trying to distinguish themselves by offering new Wi-Fi only terminals. The problem with both types of devices is the lack of flexibility. Our P5 terminal supports multiple network connection options including Wi-Fi, SIM, and Ethernet. This allows for on-the-go transactions or selling at remote events as easily as processing from the store front. Some merchants also purchase a backup terminal they use to help move long lines at the store faster. If Wi-Fi is not reliable or ethernet is preferred, the P5 also supports an ethernet connection through a connected adapter. SIM connection is also available by inserting a card into the back of the device. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"ed0ac147-f63c-4b8e-9f6d-ed8da486cb10\">Availability</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"0b6ba3eb-9b2c-4d09-b88f-907e930efabc\">Flexible Network Connectivity is available on all brands, NO additional development is required for this feature.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"ea3316d8-8379-454c-a19f-0b55cd9b8eba\">Processor</h1><table class=\"simple-table\" id=\"9d2f40fc-520f-47f7-b42a-b9102761c894\"><tr id=\"ea81a767-11f5-4604-9182-a5824aaf73c4\"><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"]PeC\">Brand</th><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"y`fa\">Available</th></tr><tr id=\"539f0ec5-8a65-4a13-9f04-a526892e3ef1\"><td class=\"\" id=\"]PeC\">Adyen*</td><td class=\"\" id=\"y`fa\">✅</td></tr><tr id=\"7de1d36d-9d6a-4219-ac81-7445738a56b0\"><td class=\"\" id=\"]PeC\">Stripe</td><td class=\"\" id=\"y`fa\">✅</td></tr></table><p class=\"\" id=\"78059074-bd5c-4db0-97bd-8afd71c2687b\">* Only the P5 supports Ethernet.

Using the Ethernet cradle will allow for a very stable and fast connection but will then tether the terminal to the dock.

With that said, since the card won’t be present for the recurring charges, any subsequent payments are considered CNP and will be priced accordingly.

With a normal refund, the payment is returned to the card used to make the original payment. With an unreferenced refund, the funds are not tied to the original payment method and the return can happen to any card. There are sometimes circumstances where this is helpful, such as if a merchant recently migrated POS systems and doesn’t have the original card information or if the original card can’t be used for whatever reason. With that said, this can easily be abused and fraudsters will use this to scam retailers and, in some cases, fraudulent merchants will try to scam us.

Below you will find details on the risks and what we have in place to provide as much protection as possible to this inherently risky practice:</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"51fd53d9-afa4-4aa7-9672-8ed4000e8a29\">Risk to Merchant</h2><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d3c6caf9-5791-45c3-8032-044d0de5abd4\"><li>They could end up owing us money. With referenced refunds, we know that they won't go negative because they've processed everything they've sold. For example, let's say someone buys a $50 item but the clerk messes up and refunds $500. Our system would still allow it through since it's under the threshold but if they've only processed $100 in sales that day then they would owe us $400 which they'd have to pay back.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"8ed93847-96e6-451e-997c-2f0a9e2cc57e\"><li>Too many refunds could equal higher penalties/fees. Refund rates over 1% of gross volume is one of the contributing factors to classify a merchant as 'High Risk' which would likely lead to higher fees, delayed payouts, or other headaches. Making refunds slightly harder by requiring them to be referenced or by refunding them through other payment methods such as store account or gift card reduces that risk and helps keep them out of that categorization.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0c895409-90f0-4d5d-bebd-cbd1499acc02\"><li>Referenced refunds provide more security and protection for the merchant. If a customer came in with a return, we could look them up using their receipt, transaction id, customer profile, reporting for a particular day, and so on. Once we've identified the transaction, the clerk just has to hit the refund button and the money goes back onto the card that was originally used. Examples:<ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d6b4d269-50bf-4a37-8112-06e75133a192\"><li>The clerk can't refund more than the original sale amount. With an unreferenced refund, we have no idea what the original sale was so if a clerk added an extra 0, they could refund $100 instead of $10 and we'd have no way to get the money back or stop them.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"8f754432-6b8a-4231-bf80-c9d21f27cc78\"><li>The clerk can't be scammed. I'll go into this more later but refund fraud is increasingly common and being used to confuse or trick a clerk into refunding money onto a different card. This could be done by a fraudster walking into the store, stealing an item then having someone else walk in with that item and demand a refund onto their card. If there was no original transaction to tie the item back to then the clerk would almost always process the refund and lose the money.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=\"\" id=\"5ee08d89-f205-484e-9742-d1a0f629faca\">Risk to Quilt</h2><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7860d6b0-75cb-4d40-af33-7046f1de337b\"><li>Refunds can cost us more than the revenue we bring in. With some of our brands using other processors, they’ve had dozens of customers that refund rates over 500% which means they refunded significantly more than they ever brought in. Their previous processor is on the hook for that money. Obviously our restrictions protect us from that scenario but it still demonstrates how bad it can be.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"03e1f7c8-6f30-4f22-aa13-ce72bfd731bb\"><li>We also want to keep our refund rates under 1% or it reflects poorly on us and could result in additional fees or penalties for us. Keeping it referenced makes it less likely it will get out of hand.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"76a674ce-9268-4867-9acf-8162965951a6\"><li>Refund fraud is increasing. As seen in the example above, it can be pretty easy to pick on clerks and confuse them into refunding money from an item stolen right off the shelf. Walmart suffered with this for a number of years. Again, our restrictions protect us but it's entirely possible that with enough refunds, the store goes out of business and we have to cover any negative balance back to the card holders.</li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"795fc1d8-8019-4147-8c59-843211e13bd8\">Additional Details</h1><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"2c98d910-e5db-4cf3-9b3a-fc0e05e98fa5\"><li>Unreferenced refunds work a little differently than normal refunds and instead behave more like Interac where the card has to be physically present to return the funds. With an unreferenced refund, the amount to be refunded is entered through the POS then the amount is passed to the terminal where it will show the total. Just like a normal transaction, the card should be tapped or inserted and the funds should appear back on the card. </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"24fcb6ea-8003-4a21-a148-856b255942c8\"><li>If a brand does not support unreferenced refunds but is having merchants complain that they need that option, we should instead point out the positive benefits of the alternatives. Instead of an unreferenced refunds, the merchant can offer refunds in the form of gift cards, store credits, etc. which means the money stays there. Being able to blame the processor for not being able to refund the money back to the card is the perfect excuse. Plus, if they really need to give the money back they can do so with cash.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6e9f14cb-851e-428f-bf0c-0e92cc4a204e\"><li>Unreferenced refunds are not retrievable so if they process a transaction they did not mean to, it cannot be reversed. </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7f1140fb-2511-439a-8573-a127ddb0a50d\"><li>In most cases, there are no fees charged for a regular, or unreferenced, refund. The only exception is with IC+(Interchange Plus)<a href=\"../Account%20Settings%207f195ada95794fcb852a5caceb633110/Pricing%20Models%20995723bfa6fd4af3ae9e3aa54c98851d/Interchange%20Plus%20(IC+)%20247c5c1c6cd14e2e9933120e20c4ae5d.html\">Interchange Plus (IC+)</a></li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"0d6f530b-3a68-40db-adf6-5aef2f7016e3\">Approval process</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"a88f1e4b-7514-4dfd-be18-bd53234a8b5c\">Requires approval from Ty Clement before this feature can be enabled. The Product manager for that brand should reach out before any work is done on it so the pros and cons can be evaluated. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"36c6f650-1ad5-4c40-ad6f-ca2337220f7f\">\n</p>",

Unfortunately we do not have timelines for these but it can be helpful to know what’s coming down the pipeline. Some of these features will require work from the PayFac team and each Brand’s development team so not everything will be available to all Brands at the same time.</p>💡Note: We should not sell these features since there is no date associated with them and their release dates and prioritization of these features is subject to change.<h1 class=\"\" id=\"44074a38-c117-4595-b977-416dc5095e4c\">Gift Card Support</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"bf069e58-ba54-4f7d-b114-9ef7429d182f\">Many merchants, especially those using IT Retail and Bottle, currently sell and utilize store gift cards. Selling gift cards benefits merchants by:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e1bfd553-4e58-41f1-8efc-49d623814106\"><li>Boosting cash flow</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1c6ba99e-f66e-40cf-9715-1ec1266bb192\"><li>Attracting new customers</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"213a4938-b339-441b-b961-dbcd82985f88\"><li>Ensuring future sales</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"37138577-c940-443d-9a33-53110af25feb\"><li>Encourage repeat business, as recipients often spend more than the card's value</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"a1fdc913-1baf-40e4-b557-a1666c397355\"><li>Reduce returns compared to traditional gifts</li></ul><p class=\"\" id=\"871ee713-5111-4322-9ed2-01c4a27456a1\">Gift cards or pre-paid cards that are powered by major card brands such as Visa or Discover are already supported on the PayFac however custom gift cards that are unique to the store, are not. Supporting gift cards requires, Tracking balances, Adding funds, Tracking new gift card sales, Expiration dates, and more. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"e1a29438-604c-4ceb-9f08-0004862470c0\">This usually means either an integration with a custom gift card supplier or us building out our own custom solution. At this time, we are considering the custom solution approach, this will take more development time but will give us more customization and flexibility over the final product.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"a6602305-77ad-4279-9866-aa95eeeb0e3b\">Payment Portal Dashboard Reporting</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"db0e67f2-8f7e-4b7b-959f-757f65fc068f\">An enhanced portal dashboard has been requested and has been added to our list of future development features.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"c442522a-c82d-4f08-8e17-8dbccf7e2028\">This would allow merchants to see sales data, compare, look for trends, areas for improvement in a visual format that will have available filters for date ranges to add clarity. This will give new business insights to merchants that may not have access to the same data through their current POS/eComm solution. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"a0987cad-be7d-4b81-a540-842523fcb74d\">In time, we may be able to integrate this data directly into a Brand’s software for an even more seamless and customized experience.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"bfd7d2da-652b-4e3c-873c-3429fd63da61\">Terminal Line Item Display</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"95dea92f-e550-40ec-af46-ea2920ce49c7\">Some locations, like California and the UK require consumer-facing displays that list each line item being purchased. The intention is to bring additional transparency and protection for shoppers that may otherwise get taken advantage of. For merchants in these locations, it can be hard to find solutions that meet these requirements and options that do exist may require additional hardware, cost, and/or setup. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"71e39b90-0296-4b77-b6d6-b3cdfc053ffa\">For these reasons, we plan to support an optional line-item display mode on the P5 terminal (would not be available with other terminals) that would display each product on the P5 as they are scanned into the register. This would work regardless of the payment method. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"24f652c9-a5e5-499a-a589-bdc515da8916\">This meets all the legal requirements of those areas and saves the merchant the time, cost, and hassle of needing additional hardware or software support. This would be an optional feature merchants could enable or disable as they wanted.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"dabba7cb-4b56-4c59-84fa-705c96f6a034\">Cash Back</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"3f6e88cd-bf0b-4954-806c-d75d417a8a01\">In some industries, like Convenience and Grocery, Cash Back is an important feature used by most merchants in that space. This will introduce additional compliance and complexity that will need to be solved prior to release. When developed and released, it will allow shoppers to indicate from the P5 terminal (will not be available with other terminals) if they wanted cash back and select an amount from a pre-configured list the merchant will configure ahead of time. This would be an optional feature merchants could enable or disable as needed.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"11400def-31d4-45d1-8f67-d3d464864784\">AMEX Direct Pricing</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"efae08eb-4252-467c-9bfe-cf388a48c138\">Amex Direct is a program by American Express that allows large merchants to establish a direct relationship with American Express for processing transactions. This program is designed for merchants who process a high volume of Amex transactions (usually &gt;$1M/month), providing them with potentially lower fees. In addition, transactions are still accepted through our PayFac but they are settled directly between the merchant and American Express, often resulting in faster funding times.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"16a3e050-97e4-45f2-8c58-937b966d4fcf\">Debit Pricing</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"7d82a397-95c3-4be5-a33e-f5ed2509ca74\">For merchants in industries with lower margins and higher overhead, pricing models like Flat Rate or Interchange Plus (IC+) may not always be sufficient and a rate for debit cards specifically is sometimes needed. When this is available, specific rates for Debit cards can be configured in lieu of the normal rate for other payment types. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"f61ef0d3-d3bf-4ffe-be4d-28ab120233f7\">This would work similar to how Interac is priced. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"05676570-d58a-48dd-b18d-7af121cff891\">BNPL (with Adyen)</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"ab477517-907e-4302-8979-616ffd0a00e2\">Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) is a feature that allows merchants to offer services like Affirm, AfterPay/ClearPay, and Klarna to consumers who want more flexible payment methods when shopping online. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"0ea28f61-a1ee-4fe0-b4f5-a57a490fad84\">Merchants using this service pay a higher fee (5.99% + $0.30) but receive orders for transactions that they may not have otherwise. Shoppers who use it are able to break the total transaction amount into smaller fixed monthly payments at no additional cost to them. </p>💡Note: This feature is currently available to our Rain Stripe PayFac merchants, but has not yet been made available to merchants on Adyen. <h1 class=\"\" id=\"a4945467-c516-48e1-8ff7-d7bf6c1a3929\">Rewards/Loyalty</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"c60217d9-bf61-4fe0-adfb-4232576b3b8a\">Merchants are always looking for new ways to draw in customers and get repeat business. Loyalty programs are a great way to do that, but the creation and adoption of an effective program is always a struggle and can take time.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"4f3cc9c2-73ab-4905-8d26-1b4f508d6b0c\">A recent example with one of our Brands, ThriftCart, merchants saw nearly a 20% increase in adoption when moving customer interactions from a tablet screen to the terminal. In addition, more and more chains and retailers are finding ways to utilize credit terminals as a marketing and advertising tool. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"85aa1a44-d7be-46c8-85f7-724d93388532\">One way we want to contribute to this is by allowing merchants to have a loyalty or reward prompts on the terminal itself allowing shoppers to enter a phone number or email to receive loyalty benefits and points. This information would then be passed to the Brand’s point-of-sale software and recorded with the transaction, this can also double as a convenience where transaction receipts are stored with the merchant, this also give the merchant shopping trends on their repeat customers for targeted ad campaigns.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"8bb526d2-2489-444b-9a6f-ad70d4b39d67\">Terminal Stand/Mount (P5 accessory) </h1><p class=\"\" id=\"cca6fc64-af29-453c-9949-4f88ad590413\">Some hardware accessories, like the ethernet cradle and the power dock, have already been released and are available for purchase. Others, like a stand/mount are not yet available, we are in negotiations with our manufacturer about different options. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"dc11a1c5-097a-41d4-84a4-3cd79b29175b\">This stand is especially important for merchants in industries like Convenience and Grocery stores where it’s commonplace for terminals to be elevated off the counter and stationary. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"8c630f62-1353-458c-b290-182a1292874c\">There are generic mounts that are available for purchase from places like Amazon. Caution needs to be taken when selecting a 3rd party stand, as the location of the controls and side mounted power adapter can make some incompatible. We are researching different options to be able to supply a recommendation for a 3rd party stand that works with the P5 terminal.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"24566843-9620-4cc7-8f90-737300aeea19\">Instant Payouts</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"ee18c334-4172-4820-8be5-d2fab36b4d39\">Instant Payouts allows merchants to transfer funds to a bank account within only 30 minutes rather then their normal 2-Day or 1-Day funding schedule. This would have an additional fee on top of their normal processing fees, but the added flexibility and control over their funds can be well worth the additional costs.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"be667eb9-51b1-4b2e-b856-bb204fd7b481\">\n</p>",

This allows merchants to more easily repay the amount since it’s flexible around their sales volume.

A majority of the time simple mistakes are why applications can’t be verified. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"1228efa0-e3ad-8024-854b-cacd88768aa0\">Each file type has different requirements to ensure their application is approved as quickly as possible. Many of these file uploads are scanned by AI to help protect their privacy and to allow for a faster resolution. That means blurry images and smudges can cause a file upload to fail so, if possible, ensure the merchant is uploading only files that meet all the requirements listed. </p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-80b9-9103-da1a8eafa311\"><li>Not cropped or cutoff</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8097-bcca-e56244e715cf\"><li>Does not have multiple documents or sides of the document in the same file</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8053-9f46-dee49022902d\"><li>Is not a screenshot or photo of another screen</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8040-96ff-e07b5f1782a2\"><li>Is not aligned poorly or upside down</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8020-90f1-da5eefa30e95\"><li>Is not a broken or damaged document</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8070-88bc-ca2fb581310e\"><li>Is not dirty or illegible</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8094-9659-e69b1b486dc6\"><li>Is not Blurry or over exposed</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-80f2-b5af-d25b86d6b8d8\"><li>Is not a black and white photo or scan</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-80f4-b909-ffdaac8bd8fb\"><li>Is a JPG, JPEG, PDF, or PNG formatted document</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-802b-906b-f945e124f620\"><li>File size under 15MB</li></ul><a href=\"Onboarding%20Error%20Flow%20(Custom%20Onboarding)%205c3bf18ef55a4f9f8acefd6a81a61948/Setup_Verification_personal_info_upload_requirements.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"10c8efa0-e3ad-8035-a8a1-da4c8dcd2caa\">Common Mistakes</h1><h3 class=\"\" id=\"1228efa0-e3ad-80eb-b970-ef62b1c08ace\">Legal Name &amp; Tax ID Mismatch</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"1228efa0-e3ad-805b-ae7d-c3818c81a508\">The most common issue with this section is the Legal Business Name and Tax ID not matching. When entering their Legal Business Name, they should enter everything on their tax document above the address as shown in the example below, including all punctuation and capitalization.</p><a href=\"Onboarding%20Error%20Flow%20(Custom%20Onboarding)%205c3bf18ef55a4f9f8acefd6a81a61948/Legal_Business_name.png\"></a><h3 class=\"\" id=\"1228efa0-e3ad-802b-8343-c13d7ac7fd48\">Incorrect Business Type</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"10c8efa0-e3ad-80d2-99dd-c66705d6de11\">The way the application process works, the business type determines what information we have to collect.

The digital file needs to be a photo taken with their mobile phone (Mobile phone includes encoded meta data in every photo that they take) in color, not be cropped, high enough resolution to be able to read and scan all codes on the front and back. The barcode and the QR code on the back of a license are scanned by AI to validate information. The front and back need to be uploaded in separate files. The photo should be taken with the ID on a flat surface with the lighting adjusted to minimize shadows on the document.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"10c8efa0-e3ad-8083-b020-ef655535d270\">If a Passport is used there is only one side of the document and it has a MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) code on the bottom of the information page, this code needs to be clear enough for the computer to be able to read that section.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-80ad-8c6f-ef99a14776a2\">Upload the image of the Passport ID page as both the front and the back on the ID to fulfill the requirement to upload the front and back of the license.</p>💡<p class=\"\" id=\"1238efa0-e3ad-8061-a52c-cfbc4a5899fe\">Note: There is a project to add a selection radial button to select the type of ID document that is being loaded that will change the requirement for documents to upload.</p><h3 class=\"\" id=\"10d8efa0-e3ad-80b0-b1fb-ecd1cd071fc9\">User Error</h3><p class=\"\" id=\"10d8efa0-e3ad-8076-b352-f939def52d99\">There are two methods of adding bank information; Instant Verification which uses the merchant’s username/password to link their account seamlessly, and Manual Entry which requires them to enter their bank details by hand and upload a banking document to validate the details of the account with. Issues with the banking section are typically with the manual entry. The document that is uploaded needs to have the routing, account number and the legal or DBA name of the business on it. If it is missing any of that information it will fail validation and need a different document to be uploaded, and will need additional time to validate.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"10e8efa0-e3ad-800a-a795-e4d07bd42c3f\">Error Code List</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"11f8efa0-e3ad-805c-ad74-fc5c8caa4291\">List of all errors with next steps and expected validation documents:</p><p class=\"\" id=\"11f8efa0-e3ad-80fc-b57d-c0a157f844dd\"><a href=\"Custom%20Onboarding%20Error%20Codes%20ecf9d72911484caa8ddd00611e9f9446.html\">Custom Onboarding Error Codes</a> </p><p class=\"\" id=\"10c8efa0-e3ad-808d-95f0-e9ab2f3fd472\">\n</p><p class=\"\" id=\"10c8efa0-e3ad-8019-b843-eb5395f313eb\">\n</p>",

This method is used by our Brands who integrated with Stripe before our Adyen PayFac was available. This article goes through the differences between our two onboarding methods.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"8bcf29c6-cf7a-47e6-848f-d090e06a09ac\">Below are some of the benefits of the custom onboarding that we have with Adyen over the hosted onboarding we have with Stripe.</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"7cfbc68c-affc-4756-97d6-571d41106dc5\"><li>Adyen gives total customization and ability to be agile. Stripe’s cannot be customized or altered.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"db362816-9f1e-4d1b-96f1-3c7f0cad2a07\"><li>Adyen allows us to control how much information is captured. Stripe collects the bare minimum information, then later requires additional information  that can be disruptive when it interrupts sales/payouts.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"abfb44b9-98c2-4bb0-9a15-59cacd2fa13b\"><li>Adyen allows us to customize the application to collect the amount of information needed based on region, industry, etc. Stripe doesn’t let us customize fields as a result they can’t accept things like EBT. Where the custom can integrate the application based on industries that use that to add a field to collect it.</li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"5c37a09a-8d56-4607-9b82-9795a2e4a3c4\">Processor </h1><table class=\"simple-table\" id=\"9cb43295-8c07-4220-9168-32cd4ad7ff6d\"><tr id=\"75efb1cc-3e6a-4bd3-976b-fff3eabe8c64\"><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"vZzX\">Processor</th><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"vKy=\">Available</th></tr><tr id=\"42db17ab-6bcb-4268-9fc6-38f7cf63b172\"><td class=\"\" id=\"vZzX\">Adyen</td><td class=\"\" id=\"vKy=\">❌</td></tr><tr id=\"0bfdbf6b-f98b-4e74-a4e5-865573159802\"><td class=\"\" id=\"vZzX\">Stripe</td><td class=\"\" id=\"vKy=\">✅</td></tr></table><h1 class=\"\" id=\"afba6c82-5afa-4fb9-aac4-d84af79894d6\">Availability</h1><table class=\"simple-table\" id=\"9abb46d8-675a-44c7-970b-21a3ea91e9f8\"><tr id=\"24acdb48-6b99-43a6-bcec-081a0432f076\"><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"{abX\">Brand</th><th class=\"simple-table-header-color simple-table-header\" id=\"J]b@\">Available</th></tr><tr id=\"e992a43f-ff8f-4226-a952-fa9947a4f1f9\"><td class=\"\" id=\"{abX\">DiveShop 360 (360 POS)</td><td class=\"\" id=\"J]b@\">✅</td></tr><tr id=\"13a32f34-64b6-4a64-9a88-21daafb9e360\"><td class=\"\" id=\"{abX\">Rain Retail (Rain Payments)</td><td class=\"\" id=\"J]b@\">✅</td></tr><tr id=\"a047f9b2-0349-4d37-83ee-696290eb5b9b\"><td class=\"\" id=\"{abX\">eTailPet (ETP)</td><td class=\"\" id=\"J]b@\">✅</td></tr><tr id=\"caf4a754-e16c-4dd3-961c-1932d98c43a3\"><td class=\"\" id=\"{abX\">ThriftCart</td><td class=\"\" id=\"J]b@\">✅</td></tr></table><h1 class=\"\" id=\"b3c855ed-9d4a-4cd6-8caf-716f3247013d\">Initial Account Setup</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"b4ab2918-fcf6-4d77-9ecc-52feb8fdc5ea\">The initial account setup is done by the onboarding team once the account has been won and determined that a Stripe account is the best fit for the merchant. Each of the listed brands above have their own domain to compete this initial setup, and the sending of the Welcome email to begin the merchants application process.</p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"54103ea7-b5d6-4706-8d6b-eafa0f918309\">Approval Process</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"950402a6-7dbb-4842-a067-ccaad4ae70b6\">The Stripe Hosted site collects Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information through their hosted onboarding application. It then securely passes a small portion of that information to the Payfac for us to be able to service the account. Stripe needs to verify three things to fully approve an account: the company, the owner/business representative. These are approved individually, if verification fails for any reason the status is updated on the application and an email will be automatically sent to all contacts under the Manage Users page with the ‘Administrator’ role. This email will let the contact know what status their application is in, what the issue is, and how to correct the issue. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"80c1a8fc-fc99-4949-8e2a-b89ff92aa0a2\">The final email that is sent once the application has been finished is an approval or denial message. If they are approved, they will receive a link and instructions on logging into the portal and begin setting up their account for use, if they are denied, the email will contain additional information on why they were denied.</p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"cfe97c83-9f04-4a3e-9d89-111efd72440e\">Documents and Information Needed</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"1f6af0cf-16af-4e11-a955-a7dacddaf963\">Bellow is a list of documents and information that will be needed to fill in all information needed on this application: Application will take approximately 15 minutes to complete if all information is available at hand.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"2e6addef-5f60-4b1d-9041-a502fe430f91\">Encourage the merchant to validate all information that has been input in the application before uploading documentation. When documents are uploaded it increases the verification time needed to manually verify documents.</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"e3000fb6-85a4-4ae5-a056-808221719344\"><li>IRS Business documentation (147C or SS-4 Confirmation letters.

        "summary": "The Hosted Onboarding application by Stripe is a non-customizable platform used by brands that integrated with Stripe before the availability of Adyen PayFac, offering a streamlined process for collecting Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information and securing account setup. While Stripe's solution provides basic onboarding capabilities, it lacks the customization and flexibility offered by Adyen, which allows for tailored information collection based on region and industry needs. The documentation outlines the initial account setup, approval process, required documents, and file upload formats, emphasizing the importance of accurate information submission to expedite verification and avoid disruptions in sales or payouts."

Occasionally verification may fail if the information the merchant submitted can’t be found. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"51821109-577e-42b6-90be-0116f7c057c2\">For example, when a social security number (SSN) and name are entered, Adyen checks it against various databases to ensure they can identify that person for tax and security reasons. If the person spelled their name wrong or entered a fake SSN then the account will come back in a Restricted status meaning we need to resubmit the information. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"19755697-0724-42b0-8733-01d6a7beb7de\">If a merchant has to upload any kind of documentation, then the merchant is no longer able to go through the automated approval process and instead must be checked manually by someone at Adyen. </p>💡Note: This works the same way at Stripe and other processors<p class=\"\" id=\"d8167f63-957e-4274-bf10-9442b6b19621\">Like any person, they are subject to mistakes and may incorrectly reject an application despite the information matching the file they uploaded. When this occurs, the first step is to review the information they entered and compare it to the file they uploaded. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, it’s best to review the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PSp0P9BfPFW1aXWuhCT1BCsO14OCihZg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107485718273632962475&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">KYC Training deck</a> for additional information. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"0f681b99-cfa1-4371-b2da-50f1f01c84f5\">If you have reviewed the information they submitted and everything appears to match, you may email the Adyen KYC team to get further clarity and/or have someone review why it was declined. Often, the person you reach out to will recognize that it was a mistake and will let you know that it’s been approved. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"3e4c7cf3-dcfa-4369-bf82-c8c9652e1586\">Contacting Adyen vs Contacting PayFac Team</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"f22e099b-b180-4528-9d8b-5228d82a9753\">When we onboard a new merchant onto the PayFac, we are telling Adyen that we believe this merchant is a legitimate business in good standing. Because Adyen shares in the potential liability of onboarding a fraudulent merchant, they have to do their due diligence as well. By providing them with the merchant’s business details, Adyen is able to verify the business and allow them to start processing. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"1667dc06-d4a3-4bdf-86c9-06d3cbd7eb23\">Because there are two parties involved in approving a new account, it may sometimes be necessary to reach out to one or both groups if an unexpected issue occurs. This section is intended to help differentiate when to go to one vs the other. </p><h2 class=\"\" id=\"3a9b7f93-ac32-4f12-899e-11a054e38970\">Going to Adyen</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"53047eb9-cc86-4047-885d-8952bde07fb5\">Contacting Adyen is required when the onboarding application has been submitted and we’ve verified that the requested file uploads match the information provided and that they are clear, legible, and up to date. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"240c90e7-5b3d-41d0-9073-a2d9347be09f\">You can do this by checking the KYC page. On the left-hand side is what the merchant entered on the application and on the right-hand side is what Adyen received. To verify the file upload is correct, click on the image and compared it to what was entered on the left. Then check the left and right sides to make sure both match. </p><p class=\"\" id=\"5a9311ee-be53-4d08-b909-45b6b0490060\">In short, if everything appears to be correct and the application has still not been Enabled then that’s when you would reach out to Adyen. </p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"933e680c-06f9-4c1f-a59c-328c181e5063\"><li>Example: The merchant entered all their information and uploaded the a file that matches everything they entered in the onboarding application and it’s still stuck in Restricted.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ad585c7a-1538-42f8-920b-0ea8f5fb3fe8\"><li>Example: The merchant uploaded everything over 48 hours ago and the account is still stuck in Pending. </li></ul><h2 class=\"\" id=\"429fa33e-aad5-47b2-a51a-d494ef206106\">Going to the PayFac Team</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"ccf04953-3d1e-4ec2-bac1-b6bd79846397\">Contacting the PayFac team is required when something is preventing the application from getting uploaded or something appears to not be working correctly.  </p><p class=\"\" id=\"003284d4-cff8-43ce-a7df-610c5fef5a59\">This is usually pretty rare but one of the more more common occurrences is when Adyen is unable to receive information the merchant has entered or uploaded. You can do this by checking the KYC page. On the left-hand side is what the merchant entered on the application and on the right-hand side is what Adyen received. If those two sides don’t match then Adyen isn’t receiving something correctly. You can try re-entering or re-uploading it again, which may solve the problem, or you can reach out to the PayFac team via a PayFac ticket with what the merchant is trying to upload.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"df848b60-1036-4f2a-ac22-326f8ac3f0b7\">In short, if something appears to be going wrong and does not appear to be behaving correctly then that’s when you would reach out to the PayFac. </p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"aae32767-e4af-42ac-a3e1-8b938b3697e0\"><li>Example: The left side of the KYC page doesn’t match the right side (meaning what the merchant entered/uploaded wasn’t received by Adyen). </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"6db567b7-6bc2-4689-83fc-8e68a6e831e5\"><li>Example: The application is preventing the merchant from uploading something or has what appears to be a bug in the process.</li></ul><h1 class=\"\" id=\"7afc9d0f-c6e0-475e-a427-b22874e39be9\">Getting the Account Holder Number</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"4cef09c2-a17c-4923-98db-ac3503b196bf\">In order to email Adyen, you will need to retrieve the Account Holder number. This can be found by going to the KYC Page of the Payment Portal and looking for the field ‘Account Holder ID’, it should start with the letters ‘AH’.</p><a href=\"Contacting%20Adyen%20KYC%20Team%2086f53ecacd3b48ecab2c8be6b9b6cb8c/Untitled.png\"></a><h1 class=\"\" id=\"86a28aed-d051-45e2-b145-c098def12e79\">Email Template</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"844674b0-1029-40bf-b647-001859204481\">When emailing the Adyen KYC team, please follow the template below:</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"d68f8d30-82db-4c38-a1bf-be6d959bafcc\"><li>TO: <a href=\"mailto:support@adyen.com\">support@adyen.com</a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"9de06ec0-19eb-412d-aa0f-ae28d23123f6\"><li>CC: <a href=\"mailto:javan.dasilva@adyen.com\">javan.dasilva@adyen.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:louis.anderson@adyen.com\">louis.anderson@adyen.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:tclement@quiltsoftware.com\">tclement@quiltsoftware.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:emin@quiltsoftware.com\">emin@quiltsoftware.com</a></li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"dee4572f-fe30-4ff2-98c9-6aaaacb3e21f\"><li>SUBJECT:  KYC &lt;<a href=\"Contacting%20Adyen%20KYC%20Team%2086f53ecacd3b48ecab2c8be6b9b6cb8c.html\">Account Holder number</a>&gt;, QuiltPayments </li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"0429fdc5-3ba8-4d8f-b40f-83b6b529664a\"><li>BODY: <ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"f2c1ee41-3edb-4f3a-81cb-e339737d055d\"><li>Specify what KYC Issue you are experiencing with your customer [e.g. Bank Verification issues, capabilities pending, technical issue etc].

Key benefits of Adyen over Stripe include greater customization, control over information capture, and the ability to tailor the application process to specific needs. </p><h1 class=\"\" id=\"58e9327f-b7b6-4912-aee7-53773fd87eb0\">Custom Onboarding Benefits</h1><p class=\"\" id=\"40e6db55-ab69-4685-8e2b-0add2789a6bb\">Below are some of the benefits of the custom onboarding that we have with Adyen over the hosted onboarding we have with Stripe.</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"ac564eec-a643-499f-8c8f-540cc8c77d21\"><li>The custom onboarding application was built by us and gives us total customization and ability to be agile. Stripe’s cannot be customized or altered.</li></ul><ul class=\"bulleted-list\" id=\"db8d3b51-ebcb-4d8e-bf02-b59dc996b9e9\"><li>Our custom onboarding allows us to control how much information is captured and when.

It then securely passes that data to Adyen who then help us validate the information we collected. With our own verification tools in addition to Adyen’s KYC checks, we’re able to safely and securely onboard merchants onto our platform and ensure we are compliant with the latest compliance regulations.</p><p class=\"\" id=\"860b403a-a5fd-494d-aadc-9f3974ff68b1\">Adyen needs to verify three things to fully approve an account: the company, the owner/business representative, and the bank account. The Onboarding application summary page breaks these areas into three sections for convenience and understanding. Each of these sections are approved individually, if verification fails for any reason the status is updated in the portal and an email will be automatically sent to any contacts with the ‘Administrator’ role in the Manage Users page of the portal about the issue and where to go to correct it.</p><a href=\"Custom%20Onboarding%20(United%20States)%20425428cc72e84923bf92243f76551675/Review_and_submit_with_single_error.png\"></a><h2 class=\"\" id=\"b47dd637-9338-4687-a2bd-596b93930b11\">Documents and Information Needed</h2><p class=\"\" id=\"b59f851e-8ddc-4379-b518-57b422efb2e8\">Below is a list of the information merchants should come prepared with to fill out the application.

It has the same functionality as the old branded payment portals but focuses on internal tools to help give administrators additional tools to support our merchants.</p>💡Note: Merchants will continue to log into each Brand’s branded payment portal.

To resolve this, users should ensure the terminal's time matches their phone's time within 60 seconds, and follow a series of steps to manually adjust the time settings, including disabling network-provided time and selecting the correct time zone. If issues persist, further troubleshooting may be required by checking additional settings linked in the documentation."
